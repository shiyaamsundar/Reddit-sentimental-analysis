b"Obligatory PSA: Our bats are [more likely to have rabies](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Rabies.aspx) than corona.   \n\n\nAnyone who is interested in finding bat caves in Southern California should be aware and take precautions to avoid being bitten by a bat. If bitten, best to get immediate medical care and prophylaxis. I know a lady who was getting into her truck and a bat had gotten in there and it bit her. Thankfully as a vet tech she knew to not let it get away and she was able to have them test it. It tested positive for rabies and she had to have treatment. [Article here.](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/local/2015/08/28/rabid-bat-bites-woman-near-thermal/71349170/)   \n\n\nBut pretty much if you [touch a bat you're getting treated for rabies](https://www.newsweek.com/when-you-should-be-worried-about-getting-rabies-bat-and-when-you-shouldnt-697273), especially if you don't have the bat for them to test. And if you do have the bat for them to test it means death for the bat as the test kills them, so really it's not good for the bat either (a healthy bat could end up dead just because you touched it). So it's best for you and the bats to just keep a safe distance, especially since it is possible to be [bitten by a bat and not even know it](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/02/480414566/bats-in-the-bedroom-can-spread-rabies-without-an-obvious-bite)."

b"Well, the Lazy Dog just opened at the McKinley shopping center, people were excited about that. Plans have been submitted to rennovate the Corona Mall on 6th and Main. The Corona Regional Medical Center is adding new buildings adjacent to its current location. Over by the 15 freeway, they're also expanding that new shopping center and hope to add another medical center there. \n\nIn boring news, the General Plan was updated for like the next 20ish years. That basically includes recommendations for what additional things the city should consider as it continues growing. \n\nWe also have a crucial Census and Point in Time count coming up quickly. There's a feeling that our demographics have changed pretty dramatically and the financial divide has also grown, so it'll be interesting to see if the data backs that up. \n\nAlso, I hear there was an owl spotted near someone's house, that was pretty cool!"

b'The farmers market at 6th and Main is pretty fun on Saturday mornings, I just wish it were larger. \n\nThe dry riverbed behind the old country club (2nd/River area) has been cleared of coyotes and homeless encampments, and is being developed.

b'I wanted to write up on how my everyday life has changed in the last couple of months living in Korea. It\'s long but felt I wanted to share it with anyone who\'s interested.\n\n  \n\n\nHow we are dealing with CORVID-19.  \n  \nIt\'s been almost 2 months since most of my kids\' classes has stopped altogether. Some earlier than others, but for a month now, everything\'s been cancelled. School and kindergarten should\'ve started on Mar. 2nd. We\'ve been told they\'ll start on the 23rd, but one, it\'s possible they\'ll postpone the date again, and two, we don\'t know how we feel about sending the kids to school even if they actually do open. We\'re starting to worry about how this will affect the older boy\'s school work and education, and we try to give him some sort of homework for him to do, at least enough to keep him from forgetting stuff he learned in 1st grade. We had a teacher come and teach him math etc. for about 30 minutes every week, and give daily worksheet to do (fairly common in Korea). That 1 on 1 class is being held through a tablet app with video chat. Pretty cool, actually. Both kids are reading a lot of books, mostly because they get bored of playing all day. I get to read book after book after book for the little one, which I kind of like. They can\'t meet their friends which is pretty sad, and we are thankful that they have each other\'s company. I hear my colleagues with single child having much harder time trying to entertain their kids.  The younger one asks me about once a day if the Corona virus is gone yet. It breaks my heart a little bit. We all need a haircut, like last month. But we\'re just letting it grow since we probably would have to take our masks off during the cut (or at least during the shampoo process). At least the hairdressers are all working with their mask on. I know because I\'ve called them and asked. If words spread around the neighborhood that some restaurants or stores have employess working without masks on, that store\'s going to have zero customers. \n  \nMy wife is a SAHM and she\'s been spending time with the two kids 24/7. They go out for a walk about once week if the weather\'s nice, all with their mask on. It\'s actually not that bad since there are few people on the street and nearby trails (other than dog owners walking their dogs). They get to take the mask off and breath in some fresh air, which is probably due to China stopping a lot of their factories leading to cleaner air in Korea. The boys (8 and 4) have learned to enjoy each other\'s company since it is their only option. They get along much better and that\'s some burden off of my wife\'s shoulders. We don\'t go out to malls or anywhere indoor at all. We used to be able to online order fresh food before midnight and they\'d be on our front door at 7am the next day, but now they\'re often sold out. We have succeeded in ordering some stuff when we order early in the afternoon or so. We take turns going to the grocery, alone, again with our mask. I try to let her go as often as I can, so she can get at least a little time by herself, even if it\'s for a short drive to and from the store. We find ourselves buying less of fresh veggies and parishables because we don\'t want to goto the store often. We end up buying more frozen food than we\'d like. She\'s come up with so many creative ways to pass the time with the kids, often transforming normal house chores into some kind of a game, but we both agree options are running out. She\'s very tired all the time and we\'re just waiting for all this to pass.  \n  \nA lot of companies in Korea have decided to have their employees work from home. That is not the case where I work, but it could change in an instant if any one of our employees turn up to be confirmed of the virus. For now, masks are mandatory. Riding the company bus, taking the elevator, walking through halls, etc. all require masks. We have a big sign in the elevator that reads, "NO MASK, NO ELEVATOR". Koreans already tend to wear mask often when they have a cold or something, but now, you get weird looks if you\'re not wearing one within the company. Sanitizers are everywhere and we\'ve gotten acustomed to just sanitizing our hands whenever we see one, without giving it a second thought. I\'ve probably used it around 30 times today. In addition, when we goto the cafetaria, there are employees with sanitizers in both hands spraying every single employees before we get in. A few days ago, we had a plastic, transparent wall installed on our cafetaria table for every spot so people eating facing each other are blocked from any unecessary droplet infection. Most social and non-essential meetings have been either cancelled, delayed or are held over phones.  We have thermo-camera things set up so everyone entering the company gets their temperatures checked, and one of our employee goes around the office taking everyone\'s temperature twice a day. People in hazmat-like suit came in the other day to disinfect/fumigate the whole office and we had to leave for 30+ minutes, which was nice because the coffee place closest to the office closed down after the whole virus thing. We were able to walk to a coffee place further away and finally get some good coffee. We didn\'t talk much because we\'d lower our mask only to take a sip of the coffee. They say it\'s going to be a weekly event. Most business trips have stopped, especially to China. \n  \nWe get several text messages from the goverment regarding CORVID-19. It used to be used for national emergencies such as earthquake warnings, heat warnings, etc. But nowadays, they\'re all about the virus. If a confirmed case in my city is found, the city immediately messages everyone (I do mean everyone in the city. I think it\'s a feature in all Korean phones and cannot be opted out) the patient\'s age/gender/location(down to which section of the city) and where they\'ve gone in the last few days or so. It gets down to specific restaurant\'s name. We also get general reminders for washing hands, wearing masks, and not attending religious/social meetings. Starting today (9th of March), we received messages on how to go about purchasing masks.  \n  \nMasks have been a huge part of our lives for the last month or so. We take them off at home, in our own cars, and in my cubicle while working (but I do keep them Butabout half the time even in my cubicle, just in case). We hear KF80, KF94 (probably a Korean mask filter-ability standard, not sure what the global standards are) are preferable, but I do have a couple hundreds of the cheap disposable ones that I bought a few weeks before the virus broke out (the ones that surgeons use), so I just use those and dispose of them after a day of use. My main concern is my habit of touching my face inadvertantly and people coughing/sneezing close to me. All the mask you can buy online are either sold out, or have gone up crazy in price. Ones we used to be able to get for less than $1 USD costs $3~5. Because of this, Korean government decided to limit Korean mask manufacturers on how much they can export compared to domestic sales (I think it was more than 90% but not sure), and the government is buying most of the mask themselves to sell to the people for reasonable price. Basically, it\'s martial law for mask sales. They tried a few methods (which had loopholes, obviously) and seem to have decided on the current method.  \n  \n2 masks per person a week. They are sold ONLY at the pharmacy, because they already have system to make sure people aren\'t perscribed medication repeatedly. Simply put, they punch in your national ID number, and they can see if you\'ve bought your ration of your masks for the week. You also have to be there in person, unless you\'re buying masks for kids 10 years or younger, or 80 or older person that you live with. Even then, it has to be your day. For example, I was born in 19x2. This means my day is Tuesday. I can buy two on Tuesday only. My son was born 2012. I can bring an official document that proves that we live together. Then I can buy 4, including 2 for my son. My wife can buy 4 on another day of the week (Monday) because she was born in 19x1, and my younger son was born in 2016 (1,6 on Monday, 2,7 on Tuesday, etc.). I will be stopping by my local pharmacy to pick up 4 masks for the kids tomorrow. This is the first week of the policy and I\'m sure there will be confusion everywhere, but I think it\'s a reasonable plan. I personally don\'t think the masks I already have are inadequate, but you don\'t know how long this CORVID-19 will last so I\'d like to buy them while I can.  \n  \nAll in all, our life has gotten much more unconfortable, but as people do, we\'ve gotten used to it. We try to watch the news on TV but turn them off pretty quickly because it makes everyone sad. I do keep up with the news online for Korea and around the world. Everyone around me agrees that if it wasn\'t for that cult, we\'d be in much better condition as a whole. We start fuming and cursing whenever the cult comes up in our conversation, and half-jokingly ask people around us to repeat the phrase, "FUCK Lee Man Hwee". He\'s the head of the cult, and "obviously" you won\'t be able to say so if you\'re part of the cult. Probably not true, but got to entertain ourselves somehow.\n\nEdit: I\'m adding small bits here and there to the text to mention any additional things that comes to mind.'
b'I started reading The Stand by Stephen King because I want to keep my anxiety at a keening pitch.'
b'Finding a job without a global epidemic is hard enough, this thing is prob gonna screw up my job search even worse.

b'I live in North Texas & I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like anyone I know, personally, actually understands what is going on. \n\nToday on my Facebook feed, these are things I saw (all by different people in my area):\n\n1. The flu is worse, there\xe2\x80\x99s only been 164 infections in the US per the CDC (posted by a local MD at our hospital & shared a couple hundred times by his patients & coworkers)\n\n2. People die of heart disease every day, people are dying of cancer...no one cares about that but you all want to panic over this over hyped virus \xf0\x9f\x99\x84\n\n3. In America, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to call into work if they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well anyway, so who cares, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of canceling big events \n\n4. (After posting how thrilled I was about SXSW) (random commenter) \xe2\x80\x9cWell you\xe2\x80\x99re a genius aren\xe2\x80\x99t you! You let the media tell you everything! I bet you don\xe2\x80\x99t even leave your house during flu season!!\xe2\x80\x9d *side note*: I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news & I literally just said i was glad they had canceled SXSW...\n\n5. I posted some compiled stats, was told I was wrong according to the CDC, proved myself correct with sources & was then told I was \xe2\x80\x9cfear mongering\xe2\x80\x9d & \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s okay if people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what you believe.\xe2\x80\x9d   *...it\xe2\x80\x99s not a belief though, it\xe2\x80\x99s scientific fact...but okay*\n\n6. ThE fLu Is WoRsE (RN x 2)\n\nThis. Was. Just. Today. \n\nNo one takes it seriously, no one is willing to take ANY extra precautions to protect themselves, so they especially don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone else. Even medical staff thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had like two counties in our state test people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared that if someone I love catches this, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to receive the care they need, because where I live, this has nothing to do with science & is 100% a partisan issue.'
b'What is the deal with newspapers paywalling coronavirus info? Since some science journals have unlocked their articles concerning coronavirus, I feel like journals should do so too, just to keep the public informed and reduce panic. Is anyone interested in petitioning someone like the NYT to make their coronavirus articles free?'
b'Maybe I\'m dumb but how do you filter posts with a specific flair? The "World", "USA", "Good News" and all are non-clickable =/'
b'I\'ve been noticing quite a few posts by (understandably) confused Americans who are wondering why people on this sub are "panicking" about coronavirus if it "only kills the elderly/compromised" and saying that we are "misinformed." I realize that a lot of folks are new to this sub so I wanted to give this quick PSA:\n\n**There is a difference between individual risk and systemic risk. Government messaging tends to focus on the former. This sub tends to focus on the latter.**\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThis is a new virus with a lot of moving parts and a lot of unknowns. Sure, all data points currently point to high survival/recovery rates for young, healthy individuals. **No sane person on this sub is disputing this.** The issue that a lot of us are trying to underscore is that, regardless of the effect that the virus will have on you *personally*, it has the potential to create real issues for healthcare systems which are not designed to handle a surge of hospitalizations/ICU patients. And even more to the point, once that system hits a breaking point, all bets are off.\n\n[This is already happening in Italy as I type this.](https://twitter.com/RachelDonadio/status/1236760190592192514)\n\nThis is why they, like China, [have decided to lockdown 16 million people.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/08/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-europe-intl/index.html)\n\nAgain, I don\'t think any sane person on this sub thinks people should "panic" in the capital P sense of the word. I certainly don\'t want anyone to panic. But it *is* important for the general population to start looking beyond how this virus will affect them individually to see the greater issues involved.\n\nWe are all in this together.  And simply dismissing any article that attempts to highlight systemic risk as "fearmongering" or "misinformation" isn\'t helping. Systemic risks are scary. We get it. But being aware of them is important because it allows each of us to make different daily choices to keep ourselves and those we love safe.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n**Edit**: Just got a DM asking why the government isn\'t saying what I\'m saying if this is "such a big deal." The answer is simple. **Dealing with individual risks is the responsibility of the citizens. Dealing with systemic risk is the responsibility of the government.** At least in theory. This is why elections matter. This is also why journalism matters. It is up to journalists to ask hard questions about how the government is navigating systemic risk. And it is up to the citizens to hold their governments accountable when those answers fall short.'
b"I'm not panicking, I'm pissed I have to do all this by myself since the government is showing its incompetence"
b"People need to learn the difference between Crude Mortality Rate and Case Fatality Rate (CFR). I have seen a lot of people and organizations downplaying the risk by simply citing the Crude Mortality Rate.\n\n# Crude Mortality Rate:\n\n`(deaths) / (total confirmed cases)`\n\n# Case Fatality Rate:\n\n`(deaths) / (resolved cases)` or `(deaths) / (deaths + recovered)`\n\nWhen someone gets infected, there are three potential states they can be in:\n\n1. Actively infected\n2. Recovered\n3. Dead\n\nSo for example, say I have a cruise ship where we test everyone and discover that 1000 people are/were infected. 150 are now recovered. 10 are dead. That's a 1% fatality rate, right? `(10 deaths / 1,000 infected = 0.01 = 1%)`\n\nWell, no; remember that we're in the *middle of the outbreak*, and that there are still *840 people still sick*. They will eventually recover or die. We cannot simply assume that they will all recover, nor can we simply assume that they will all die.\n\nIt's worth noting that crude fatality rate, the methodology that most often is used by the everyday news agency or internet denizen, gives you the best-possible scenario number. It's basically assuming that all unresolved cases will lead to recovery. **This is very misleading.**\n\nEnter Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which is used by epidemiologists to track *resolved* cases in an ongoing epidemic; this data gives us potential insight into how the remaining 840 active cases might turn out when all is said and done. The CFR for the aforementioned scenario is, so far, a much-higher 6.3% `(10 deaths / (10 deaths + 150 recovered) = 0.063 = 6.3%)`\n\nWith that CFR, you might estimate the remaining 840 current cases will eventually resolve to another 53 deaths, depending on demographics and a lot of other factors. `(0.063 CFR * 840 infected = 53 fatalities)`\n\nWhen all the cases come to a conclusion, and the epidemic stops, both crude mortality rate and CFR will settle to be the exact same percent. But in the middle of an outbreak -- where there is exponential growth, and most of the cases are new and the disease takes weeks to run its course -- the CFR metric is objectively superior.\n\nNow admittedly, CFR is not a perfect metric, and here's why:\n\n1. The CFR may be inflated if there are lots of mild to moderate cases that slip under the radar. The ratio of actual cases to confirmed cases depends on that region or country's rate of self-reporting, screening, and follow-up testing. Less testing typically means a higher CFR, which reflects what is currently happening in the United States.\n2. The CFR may vary wildly between age/gender demographics, comorbidity with other preexisting conditions, and/or access to quality healthcare. So you would expect to see CFR values differing between populations.\n3. The CFR may be temporarily inflated if the average time-to-death is shorter than the average time-to-recovery. If so, you'll see the CFR slowly drop as recoveries lag behind the initial wave of deaths.\n4. The CFR may be inaccurate if it initially sweeps through a certain demographic first. For example, COVID-19 fatality rates are almost non-existent for children, but high for the elderly. You'd see pretty significant CFR difference if it were to hit elementary schools before nursing homes, or vice-versa.\n\nSo CFR isn't the end-all-be-all, but we should think of CFR as a potential upper band, whereas crude mortality is a potential lower band. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nNote: the current global COVID-19 CFR at the time of writing is **5.8%***.* `(3,828 dead / (3,828 dead + 62,225 recovered) = 0.058 = 5.8%)` Loose napkin math, we could potentially estimate that 43,963 currently infected may eventually resolve to an additional 2,550 deaths. `(((110,016 infected - (62,225 dead + 3,828 recovered)) * 0.058 CFR = 2,550 fatalities)`"

b'Hi all, Question. My spouse & I have air travel planned next week to attend a festival in a city where there are currently NO coronavirus cases.\n\nThere are cases in our area. From a moral standpoint, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spread the virus if I am a carrier.  Also, If I do contract it from community spread at home, I would want to be quarantined at home, not in a city across the country. \n\nWe are not afraid of getting sick - we are healthy and in our late 20s - but we are afraid of the potential of being grounded in that city for an extended period of time. \n\nQuestions:\n(1) If I needed to be quarantined in another city, I would be SOL as far as cost coverage, right? I assume I would not be moved to a military base for recovery like the cruise ship passengers. Unless my condition required hospitalization, I would need to pay out of pocket for hotel costs. Private health insurance, home insurance, umbrella insurance would not cover that. Is this right? \n\n(2) We are concerned about the possibility of not being able to return home easily. While flights probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be grounded, is it possible that certain airports will not accept flights if the virus is bad enough in that city? \n\nWe really wanted to go on this trip but we are wondering if the responsible thing to do - from a financial and time perspective - would be to skip it, since it seems like shit is hitting the fan fast. Thanks for your thoughts.'

b'> @realDonaldtrump\n\nSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\n\n> 10:47 AM \xc2\xb7 Mar 9, 2020\n\n\nWhen the government is telling you this is all okay, nothing to see here move along, why?\n\nWhy broadcast a message so different then what is being said all around the world. And not even a moderated message with a centric viewpoint, a straight denial.'
b"Now, assuming eventually getting infected is inevitable as an American (which isn't true, but as the situation unravels it seems like trying to avoid the virus for months on end will become less and less practical for a lot of people)... Would it actually be in my best interest as a young, healthy adult to get infected as early on in the course of the outbreak as possible? (also assuming I'm successful in not infecting anyone else)\n\n[https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/](https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/)\n\nHear me out. According to epidemiologist Trevor Bedford, the virus mutates at an average rate of once per two weeks. The transmission rate is roughly once per week from incubation to transmission to the next host, so you can think of the virus gaining a new point mutation between every two infections on average. The first case sequenced in the US on Jan 15 was found to be the ancestor of another case sent in on Feb 28, with 3 new point mutations in between. So my other question is: over time, will the mutations that increase the virus' hardiness/destructiveness be selected for? Right now the odds of the virus killing a young, healthy person like myself are very low, so if I were to get infected early, take all precautions, quarantine myself etc. until I've recovered and gained antibodies/immunity, would I most likely be immune to potentially more dangerous strains that emerge in the future? Does the immunity just last until the virus mutates in the epitope region? How quickly is this thing evolving compared to other recent epidemic viruses?"

b'Why do people say that this is all an over reaction and the common flue killed more people. They do not take it serious. I hear this especially from good friends and family members,\n\nI try to explain them the points like that this is just the beginning, that this is a novel corona virus, and that the infection rate is very high. I also tell them that the fatality rate is also higher. But they take nothing serious and play down the whole situation.\n\nThey compare absolute numbers from the common flue when the fatalaty rate was extraordinary high with the current available data from SARS-CoV-19. I could go crazy when I hear that. Sometimes they not even try to talk about the highs of the common flue. They simply say that the common flue kills more people than corona. This is not true. They do not even know the exact name of the virus. Almost nobody.\n\nThey also say, when I tell them my arguments, "what should we do? Should we stay home all the time". I never said something like that. I tell them to be onlu more cautious and wash their hands better.\n\nAnd this are only two examples of such discussions.\n\nI do not understand such an behavior. They only thing about themselfs. Such an behavior is egoistic and irresponsable. One could transport the virus to someone loved. This person could be responsible for the death of other people. I know that this is the worst case. You could be the one who let other persons have a really hard time in hospitals.\n\nThey let me stay in discussion like i am overacting or overreacting. But I think they are the real morons when they laugh at people who take also real care on others.\n\nThis are people who almost never stop to speak to others and give advice over advice. They spread ignorance, disinformation, lies and could give other people a dalse sense of the situation. Such people could be also responsible for deaths of other people no having contact with since they talk to other so much.\n\nI am wheather a professional and not a scary person. I cannot stand people like the one described above. But I still love them. But I trust them now less and doubt their intelligence now more than ever.\n\nWhat do you think?'

This was reported about a week ago, and no new cases have been confirmed by the university. \nHowever I'm a bit skeptical and not sure why classes aren't cancelled yet, since many businesses are telling their employees to work from home already. Of course with this mindset and knowing I could potentially be infected already, going to like 4 cities across Europe doesn't sound like the best idea... am I overreacting?"

b"Is it TRUE that (COVID-19) stops from spreading in Summer ? Or it's just another lie !!"

b"Questions to people in the UK. Excuse my English.\n\nI just read a post on Facebook about the Corona virus in the UK by a Vietnamese (my country) woman who is living in London. She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously, they still think this is just a normal flu, people still hanging around without a mask. She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus. It's very hard to buy a mask too, the price is getting higher. And if you have the symptoms of the virus, u call 111, but if you don't have all the symptoms (fever, cough, pneumonia) then the doctor won't come to test you. Her Vietnamese friend had to pretend that her symptoms were very serious (coughing on the phone etc..) and she get tested, but the result came after 3 days (!!!). If the result is positive then you have to self quarantined at home, there would be a phone call everyday but nothing more, you gonna be okay anyway. The person with the virus cannot go to the hospital unless it's very serious because they are afraid that they will spread it to other doctors and patients.\n\nIs that all true? Well you can't believe everything on social media so I'm here to ask. Hope to get a honest answer. Thank you"

b"Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.

b'Thank you for sharing your experience. I appreciate that you took the time to write about it and share it with us.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little worrying elsewhere imagining that more of us may find ourselves in a similar situation soon.\n\nAt least we\xe2\x80\x99ll all know we\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in our efforts and difficulties. There\xe2\x80\x99s an irony in feeling together in staying apart.\n\nI hope that treatments for serious cases will gradually improve as we learn more about this disease, and the rate of transmission will slow partially because we\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to contain it, and eventually a good portion of the population may recover from it and be immune and unable to catch or spread the same version again. \n\nIf we can try to slow the rate of spread enough to keep up with treating the most serious cases and try to isolate the most vulnerable from getting it until that time, then things may work out pretty well.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but we do know that this probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be forever, and life will move forward eventually.'

b'Very insightful, thanks for sharing. It shows how you guys are taking a bottoms up cultural approach to combating the virus (eg no mask, no elevator) and the text messaging system. It also shows how absolutely unprepared Western countries are. \n\nIf President Moon had also taken a firmer approach once the virus had spread, you guys would be much better off too.'

Coronavirus on the other hand is a new disease and no one knows shit about it we\'re still researching the coronavirus to see just how bad it is. Not to mention we have a vaccine for the flu and for the coronavirus a vaccine is atleast a year away if not longer. Lastly you just need to look at how fast coronavirus is spreading every day and most research points to the coronavirus having a higher death rate then the flu. \nNot to mention with more and more people getting infected everyday we could potentially see a massive increase in the death rate within the next few weeks'

Smaller amounts will still dry you out and therefore feel effective but it takes 20 seconds so don't skimp."

b"Speaking from one of the hospitals in the Seattle area, we do not allow visitors for suspected and confirmed Covid patients. The hospitals in this area also have the same policy. One of my nightmares is that my parents get it, are hospitalized, and I wouldn't be able to see them again."
b"If I'm able/allowed to visit, absolutely. I'll wash my hands thoroughly before & after, but I'm not in a high-risk category; I'm not very worried about myself. And I know I can help my parents de-stress significantly, which will help them recover.\n\nEdit: A lot of it would depend on circumstances, though. Some folks don't have good/close relationships with their parents, some aren't able to travel to where their parents would be, some folks are at higher risk or live with folks at higher risk & it may not be worth the risk for them, etc. I wouldn't judge folks who chose differently than me; this is just *my* answer.\n\nSecond edit: Also for the record, everyone should always wash their hands before & after any hospital visit. Before, for the sake of the folks being treated there, and after, for your own sake & those around you at home."

b"My parents? Lol no. If they wanted sympathy on their death beds they probably shouldn't have put their cigarettes out on my chest.\n\nBut let's say your relationship with your parents is normal. What good is visiting them going to do? They will be in isolation. It's not like you can go in and talk to them without wearing full PPE. You can maybe tap on their window and wave or something, but it's probably better to just Skype with them if they aren't intubated."

I already work from home so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep them off screens and have them do Kahn Academy, books, and documentaries.  It is only a two day week for parent teacher conferences.  I think a combination of the lack of testing and the middle school being kept open in Hillsboro was what pushed me over the edge.  We aren\xe2\x80\x99t that worried but both kids took turns being sick last week and now I have the sore throat and cough my oldest did.  Pretty sure my oldest had RSV and not Covid but staying home seems like the safer move for everyone.'
b'I just bought a little extra of what i normally buy in case my household is quarantined or supplies become limited because of factories closing or limited importing.

A little extra cleaning supplies, toiletries, food that i would eat anyway, meds i use, dog food.\n\nI have the ability to keep my house running just as before for at least a full month or so without shopping. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for long term power or water outages because so far that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an issue in even the hardest hit places.\n\nThe plan is to keep this extra safety barrier up for a year or so, i guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll know if it gets eradicated sooner.

b"Tbh it's no wonder it's spreading so much given how the NHS are responding.\n\nMe and my partner just got back from Amsterdam, now he's got a temperature, cough and headache. Called 111 and was told by someone at PHE that I needed to speak to someone from 111 and get a test organised as people have been coming back from there with cases. Get through to 111 guy who basically says they can't do anything unless you've been to one of the countries on their list. Which is ridiculous if you've been through any airport as you have more than likely been close to someone who HAS been to one of those places. There's definitely way more cases than they think there are if they're flat out ignoring anyone who hasn't been to Italy Iran China or South Korea."

Trump is 73, Bernie is 78, Biden is 77. Not good ages for catching this, especially if they have any pre-existing conditions.\n\nI imagine no hand shakes, keep people 6+ ft away at times... Maybe we see secret service freak out and tackle someone for sneezing or coughing lol who knows. \n\nYou're right though, people who are famous/in positions of power have a really high chance of catching this."
b"Yea the dorm situation is not good for spreading an illness. However, neither is traveling through crowded airports to get home to you parents. I would not leave to avoid getting sick as getting home you very well may pick it up and then spread it to your parents. If your main concern is being stuck in Germany while sick but would rather be home, that's another thing. If you do come home, I would self quaratine for 14 days before visiting with friends and family and airports are hotspots. (especially if you're concerned about your parents getting sick.)\n\nYou're allowed to do whatever you want for personal reasons."
b'The Government should never be your role models'
b"We don't really know yet."
b'It might spread slower in warm weather. Australia and south America will show us in the coming weeks'
b"We don't know.\n\nTypically, but not always, respiratory viruses like coronavirus or the flu slow down in hotter more humid weather.\n\nIt's reasonable to think that's probably going to be the case now with this virus, but there's currently no direct evidence that it will happen."
b"We don't have data on Covid-19's longevity at temperature yet.\n\nBut similar viruses persist for days at 30C on various surfaces.\n\n [https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext)"
b"Currently experiments indicated the virus will be killed fast at temperature of 56 celsius.  \nThat's the only information about temperature which can be proved. \nHowever due to spread situation in Singapore  Thailand,  Malaysia.  it make people believe that when summer comes the virus maybe gone or at least not so aggressive \nMaybe the temperature is a factor,  maybe it's not about temperature but about the ultra violet ray. \nBut for now,  we could only say we don't know."
b"Don't use cash.\n\nDo yoga in your living room."
b"Westchester here - Nope, no due diligence whatsoever. I told my local cafe that I'm suspending my weekly quiz out of an abundance of caution because I see zero proactive measures on my city..."
b'Stay somewhere else for two weeks, and then get the place cleaned before you move back in.'
b'Move'
b'Change your locks.'
b'Stock up on non perishables in the event both of you become quarantined.'
b"Not sure what the CDC or DoS' advice is, particularly for returning travelers from Italy. But really, he needs to self-isolate himself to his own room for 14 days. If he has his own bathing facilities excellent, if not he'll have to disinfect literally everything he touches or uses in the bathroom. But really the advice we're getting here in the UK is you basically need to seal him off; bring food to his door, run his errands. It's a big task, and not one I would do unless there wasn't an alternative for him - like his family home or whatever."
b'Los Angeles and the airport specifically are hubs of transmission. The best thing would probably be for your family to join you in Italy early and wear gloves and masks on the road. One flight instead of three. Flight availability may reduce at any moment too'
b"That's just one major event in one country.\n\nEveryday thousands are packing into arenas, night clubs, concert halls, churches, schools, mass transit, movie theatres, lecture halls, just to name a few. \n\nIf it truely has an R0 of 3, how you stopping it."
b'Japan seems to be under reporting and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the Olympics. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of money invested in it.  They should cancel.'
b"We'll know in a week or two. It's really looking like no"
b'Dude summer is still so far out.\n\nNext 2-3 weeks you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a lot of clarity.'
b'If you are offered a refund, I would probably just take it.'
b'I also have flight to Florida to visit 60+ relatives in less than two weeks. Almost all have underlying conditions. Airline announced they would reschedule flights and waive a fee. I am going to see how it pans out this week - if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t leaving soon, I would wait a few more days. Supposedly millions of kits will be available tomorrow and things may change drastically.  Personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the one to introduce the virus to my relatives.'
b'i think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign to stay home, especially if the airline offered a refund. i am in the same position. i had a trip scheduled to visit my dad in arizona (56) and i\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of cancelling too.'
b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s a good cancellation deal I\xe2\x80\x99d do it. And is also make sure your dad has a good supply of stuff and home and doing social distancing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be fine but the risk of carrying it to your dad is the scary part, so make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s ok the best you can from afar.'
b"You're not alone in being in this sort of situation.   \n\n\nDepending on when your flight is, the situation may evolve a bit between now and then. Also, official guidelines and recommendations may change.  \n\n\nIt might be a good idea to figure out what your options would be if you do want to cancel for a refund and stay where you are or go anyhow. Know your options, and see how the situation evolves, and make the best decision you can."
b'If you live in Wuhan/China, yes. Otherwise...probably going to get worse before it gets better.'
b'\nI am glad you asked.\nHere a video .\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg'
b"They dont ban accounts who say it's a hoax or just a flu. Fuck twitter"
b"Because you're spreading misinformation."
b"I think it's unlikely all of those countries will allow entry by April. Or that if they do you still want to go. Sorry, it sounds like a fun trip."
b'Not at all.'
b'Not irrational at all.'
b"No; it makes sense to at least weigh your options and assess the situation.\n\nStuff to consider in your decision include how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b"France is having it real bad right now, and aren't showing any signs of extreme clamping down on the problem.. Not sure you wanna go ahead with the trip. Might be wise actually"
b'I think you need to inform all that someone associated with your school has is being tested and that once the test results are in you will no more. Keep everything about the person confidential. Always remember a good leader thinks about the whole and getting out ahead of this is probably best.'
b"They're not getting hit particularly hard.  It's just that we can only compare them to China and South Korea, two countries which used strict, widespread quarantines to slow the spread of the disease.  Italy is now trying (unsuccessfully) to quarantine an affected region; quarantines are not going to work in Iran.\n\nAs the virus spreads, most countries will look more like Italy and Iran than China."
b"They didn't manage to contain early cases as well, so they're several weeks ahead of other countries in virus progression."
b"I assume it's due to their close knit culture.  In Italy it is common to greet one another with a hug and/or light kiss on the cheek.  In Iran their religious culture revolves around praying with one another in close contact, ie mosques."
b"We're not sure; we think somewhere between hours and a few days. Worst-case guesstimate is 9 days, based on behavior of other coronaviruses.\n\nIt could, if an infected person coughed or sneezed on the sweater, and then an uninfected person touched that surface & later touched their eyes/nose/mouth without washing their hands in between."
b'Because if the economy fails he has no basis for his re-election'
b"It's not guaranteed that mutations will make the virus stronger. I've actually read that mutations will tend towards decreasing death rate so to as ensure maximum transmission. We also don't yet understand the full long term ramifications of getting this virus. It would be silly to attempt to get it on purpose and may end up being something you regret doing."
b"I'd really ask an actual doctor about that before you even consider it, and... it just really feels like a bad idea to get infected intentionally."
b'China has been testing one million per week for several weeks, so no need to count.\n\nS.Korea has been doing a great job, by testing more than 20 thousands cases by far.\n\naround 1000 cases tested in USA and less than 2000 in Japan'
b'the only compilation list I have seen is from March 2: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/\n\nhopefully that will get updated soon, and it is far from a complete list but it at least gives you an idea. \n\nsome of those numbers come from government updates that are sent out as notices, instead of updating a central page, so they can be quite tedious to find. \n\nthe UK numbers are easy to find because they publish them on a gov site: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\n\ncanada posts the numbers in three different places, they all need to be added up:\n2008 + 553 + 2178 = 4,739 people tested, as of March 6\n\nsources:\nBC- http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus\n\nontario - https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus\n\nrest of canada - https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html'
b'India has 43 confirmed cases till now and we have tested more than 600000 people.'
b"If you're recently diagnosed and on Plaquenil, then it would be best to call your rheumatologist's office and communicate your concerns. Things like your ANA and C-reactive protein levels are easily available to them and they can advise you better than anyone on the internet. Lupus is what happens when your immune system goes haywire and starts attacking your own tissues, the medications are given in an effort to get the inflammatory process under control. Sometimes you have to experiment with different meds to get the right response; this is why the ANA and CRP are so important to monitor, that's how the rheumatologist knows if they're getting it close to right.\n\nDon't just stop your meds without talking with the rheumatologist office. They might actually advise you that it is appropriate to suspend taking them at times when you have an active infection. A phone call to the provider who knows your case is free, and doesn't have negative consequences for you.\n\nGood luck with all of this, it's been 4 years on Cellcept for me."
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Lupus but someone in my family has another autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis) and her doctor told her that she\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to require medical attention should she contract the virus, because of the biologicals she is on. Maybe best to ask your doctor if you can.'
b'Statistically not possible.  The Coronavirus had certain fatality rate for each age group. For President at age 74, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 8%(70-79yrs)\nFor VP it\xe2\x80\x99s 3.6% (60-69yrs) \nPlus all the heavyweight politicians had access to top medical facilities with highest priority, Even if they are infected, chance any of them dying is very slim. (Less than 1%, just like a flu)'
b"There is a chain of succession that goes to, like, fifty people. It won't come to that. Even if you're old, the odds of dying are still quite low. This isn't ebola."
b"If you've been exposed it's two weeks to make sure you don't have it. Working from home if you're able is indefinitely. If summer heat kills this thing it'd end then."
b'Its up to 2 weeks. You could show symptoms even quicker but 2 weeks is a good quarantine if exposed to find out if itll show.'
b'It is mostly older folks & folks with underlying conditions, especially ones that impact their lungs, heart, or immune system.'
b'Bad virus'
b'It may also be that more news and articles are being posted online and in the sub related to the US, because there\xe2\x80\x99s the number of cases and widespread concern are both growing there.'
b'Use RES and setup a filter for the Flair USA and exclude it. That way the sub becomes much more usable again.\n\np.s. this is a credit to the Mods for flairs!'
b'There are many smaller subs for specific areas try searching your country + coronavirus.'
b"Corona tends to be mainly fever and a dry cough while the flu tends to also have sore throat and runny nose, but you can't distinguish by the symptoms alone."
b'By testing. Impossible otherwise.'
b'Where are you from?Bangladesh?'
b'Where are you located?'
b"I don't think so.  The n95 mask uses electrostatic filters to prevent dirt. The medical device developer in the news reported that using heat, water or alcohol would damage the filter. I've never heard of an ozone generator, but water and heat measures are 100% damaging the filter, and most temporary measures are not good.\n\nkor news: [http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call\\_from=naver\\_news](http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call_from=naver_news)"
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s 2 weeks away, a lot can change in that time.  I\xe2\x80\x99d wait to cancel.'
b"''phase out just like that?''\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not phasing out, they simply took extreme measures that led to the decrease and some degree of containment."
b'Spanish flu had 3 phases. China is a communist country with no freedom of speech. China is always lying.'
b"Giving specific medical advice is frowned upon.\n\n\nWithout a test there's really no way to know if you have the nCoV, or one of the many other communicatable viruses, infections common in the world. All you can really do is treat your symptoms, limit your exposure to others like you should for any illness, get rest, maintain fluids and dietary intake. \n\n\nFor the vast overwhelming majority of cases it is mild to moderate symptoms that mirror the flu. I have a personal belief that mental health plays a big part of recovery, if you're worried and anxious you impact your body's ability to fight. \n\n\nIf you're worried keep a diary of your symptoms and any vitals you can monitor."
b'There are reported cases or a risk of community spread of COVID-19 in Antarctica.\n\nIf you travel to Antarctica:\n\nAvoid contact with sick people\nClean your hands often by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%\xe2\x80\x9395% alcohol\nPay attention to your health for 14 days after returning to the US. Stay home and seek medical advice if you get sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing\nAvoid travelling if you are sick\nVisit CDCs webpage for additional information about COVID-19.'
b'Extremely rarely.  Its hard to track exact numbers since its tough to 100% attribute a death to flu, so CDC mostly track pneumonia deaths and deaths that the doctor actually says was flu caused.  So most numbers you see are estimates.  But its around .1% or less for that age group.  Often these people have some sort of underlying undiagnosed issue which made them more susceptible, but you also just get an unlucky person sometimes.  Here are the numbers from 2018-2019.  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html'
b'My sister\xe2\x80\x99s friend passed away a few months ago and she was only 24. No health issues. Unfortunately it happens and doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.'
b"It's really your decision whether or not to go; we can't make that call for you. But stuff to consider in that decision are how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b'You are not overreacting. \nWait till Thursday check the numbers in Spain and the neighbours and decide.'
b'Sad news is fatality in college students are very low. (Which means most of them don\xe2\x80\x99t care) \nBut they do spread out the virus to all parts of states,  their parents should be worried.'
b"Not an expert but here what me and my husband have been doing. Wash hands asap, don't touch anything, dry hands off with paper towel or put towel in laundry right away. Disinfect the knobs with Lysol wipe."
b'He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in the first place.\n\nBut if he do come into your house,  you two are basically bonded together if your two don\xe2\x80\x99t wear masks in house.'
b'I told my parents so they won\xe2\x80\x99t freak out on Coronavirus.  \nBut honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.   \nThe SARS (which is another Coronavirus) disappeared in Late May 2003.  So there are some chances, but nobody knows for sure.'
b"What's true is: nobody knows. People who say this are speculating. This disease is more infectious than the flu and it is currently spreading in southern hemisphere countries that are actively in summer. A more likely speculation is that spread may slow in the summer due to a number of factors (kids out of school, more vitamin d in people's systems, warmer temps mean it lives shorter periods on surfaces), but it will still spread."
b'If it was so why are we seeing spread into the warmer tropical climates. Singapore is aggressively managing but still reporting cases and has temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius everyday.'
b'Many viruses "tend" to prefer cooler temps and may not last as long on surfaces in warmer weather.  This is true of the flu and why you see it drop off in warmer temps.  I suspect no one can give a correct answer for whether this strain will be the same way as it is present in warmer countries right now.  Also, in the summer people are outside more, school is out, there tends to be less transmission.  I suspect we will see a lull over the Summer (in the northern hemisphere) with maybe even a return of it in the Fall.'
b'The majority of recovery come from China, they had the virus under control.  With less than 100 cases per day and decreasing.\n\nBut in other parts of world,  the cases doubles every two or three days.'
b"> She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously\n\nOur problems here are similar to issues across, I imagine, a lot of the Western world. In that we *don't* experience existential challenges or threat regularly, if at all, and so are less inclined to recognise the severity of a situation or threat until it becomes very apparent it is real. Also the experience and outlook of a Londoner, a very young reasonably healthy and affluent City, will be different our towns. I think a lot of people are happier to risk it than sit indoors. \n\n> She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus\n\nAlso sadly think this will likely be because the woman is Asian and either consciously or subconsciously people, in a confined setting, will act differently around her - naturally this is racist. \n\n\nWith regards to testing, the UK Govts advice or treatment approach doesn't change, irrespective of whether you are tested or not, positive or not. Stay at home, self-isolate - the UK government have introduced laws to make it easier to obtain statutory sick pay and employers here are seemingly very comfortable with you working from home or being sick. There's very little the NHS can do for someone with a mild fever and so if you claim to have more severe symptoms they will act more assertively. In the context of limited capacity to carry out tests, this is the right thing to do."
b"I'm from the UK, and it all sounds roughly correct.\n\nYour post makes it sounds like you think the above is a problem.\n\nThe UK (Government & Public) **are** taking it seriously, we just aren't succumbing to hysteria and panic.\n\nIf/when we get to the point where there are tens of thousands of infected, I imagine attitudes will change and people will be more aggressive in distancing/isolating. Until then, we'll keep washing our hands, avoiding touching our faces, and self-isolating if we display symptoms, as advised by the NHS and other experts."
b'Chances are she just has cold/flu.  That is extremely more likely, but there is always a chance she has covid-19.  She should call her doctor and get a recommendation.  That is what the CDC is telling people to do who think they are sick.'
b'Why bother getting tested?  If you (and they) are worried, just take the same precautions as if they have it.   Treat symptoms and self-quarantine.'
b"Same thing in the UK with me. Called 111 and they said it was just a cough. Four days later I call again and they say it's a chest infection \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 hopefully it doesn't progress"
b"Sorry not helpful but I saw a video on Youtube of a man in China volunteering to feed pets in people's homes. They were abandoned due to Wuhan being quarantined so owners outside the city can't return. The video description estimates 30,000 pets abandoned in the city."
b'Sure they are. The government of Iran never tells the true numbers.'
b'Seattle is a prime spot for Cruise Ships. That could have something to do with it.'
b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter. If it had hit a daycare facility or elementary school, there would be no deaths at all. But there probably would have been faster community spread, from those kids to their parents and then beyond.\n\nSource: Am a parent. Have had many cold and flu bugs brought home by our kids over the years.'
b"There's only a ~10% household transmission rate, so I wouldn't take it as a given, no. Definitely still worth doing what you can to prevent it, even if that's just regular hand washing & covering your mouth & nose with a tissue or elbow when you cough or sneeze.\n\nThat being said, if one of you get it, ideally both of you should self-isolate and stay home."
b"Not enough info.  If she's going to be in a large group, where in Seattle, etc."
b'Hi! I live in Seattle.\n\nThe likelihood of your mom contracting the virus and passing it on to you and the kids is small, but definitely not zero.  She will probably be fine if she observes the commonly-suggested hygiene practices, e.g., thorough and often hand-washing, covering coughs, keeping a 6-foot distance between herself and others as much as possible, etc.\n\nIs her trip to Seattle absolutely necessary?  Is the small chance of contracting Covid-19 worth it?\n\nHonestly, if she were my mom and the "one day trip" was recreational, I\'d urge her not to go.  Or at least postpone it for a few months.'
b'Seattle is essentially shut down right now. There is talk of bringing in the military. Your mom should not go.'
b'Toucht anything contaminated without washing your hands correctly, or getting closer than 2 meters to an infected person can result in contagion. If you are in an active circulating virus region.'
b"If you keep your distance from other people and don't touch things, it's perfectly fine to go out for a walk."
b"no, why. the virus isn't airborne. you might wanna skip on large gatherings, unnecessarily using public transport etc"
b'Occasionally it gets a hug of death when someone features it on a major TV show like BBC or CNN'
b"We don't know yet. There's some reports of re-infection, but those could've been folks who just hadn't fully recovered from the initial infection. It also remains to be seen how much it mutates/how impactful those mutations are."
b"That's not the problem as far as testing goes. Plenty of people want to be tested, but the tests the CDC produced were fucked up and now they don't have enough functional tests to test everybody who wants one. Even the hospitals who have suspected cases cannot get those patients tested. \n\nThe problem in the US is a lack of test availability. Whether this is due to incompetence or politics is an ongoing debate."
b'Coronavirus still hasn\'t beaten "Talking about fantasy football", but is well ahead of "Complaining about the last season of Game of Thrones."'
b"Delusions. I'm a pretty pragmatic person and I don't give in to hype, but this virus is far from peaking. I expect a peak near the end of the year, with likely millions of cases. This virus isn't just going to go away, and every new community transmission in a different city is a potential Wuhan, which peaked two months in"
b"I couldn't get past the first three paragraphs. Comparing this to the flu is just stupid. What does that have to do with anything? 20,000 die on the road. Are we just listing stats. It then went on to talk about a percentage and again list the total flu numbers, after an entire flu season. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, cool, but that conservative tabloid is shit. \n\nThat's what I think of it. See some of my other comments if you want my opinion. It's not good."
b'I like it, good to see a positive spin. Everything is too doomsday right now.'
b'NY Post, not NY Times.'
b'Tell them that the 2nd wave of Spanish Flu was the deadliest one. That will shut them up.'
b"Masks help fight the spread of the virus. With that said, if you are sick or suspected to be infected, you should quarantine yourself in which case you will not need a mask. Avoid purchasing masks as it will then limit the supply for healthcare providers (I'm a healthcare provider who is also in charge of infection control and pandemic disease at my facility. Please do not buy masks)."
b"[Here's some info re: symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdf5fq/we_are_a_team_of_medical_experts_following/fjhvk5y/?context=10000)\n\n> This is from an analysis of 55,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China:\n\n> Symptoms include:\n\n> 87.9 % - Fever\n\n> 66.7% - Dry Cough\n\n> 38.1% - Fatigue\n\n> 33.4% - Sputum production\n\n> 18.6% - Shortness of breath\n\n> 14.8% - Myalgia (Muscle Pain) or Arthralgia (Joint Pain)\n\n> 13.9% - Sore throat\n\n> 13.6% - Headache\n\n> 11.4% - Chills\n\n> 5.0% - Nausea or vomiting\n\n> 4.8% - Nasal congestion\n\n> 3.7% - Diarrhea\n\n> 0.9% - Hemoptysis (Coughing up blood)\n\n> 0.8% - Conjunctival congestion\n\nSo the main symptoms are fever & dry cough."
b"Right now, not too bad. The population of London is about 9 million and there are only ~300 cases confirmed in the UK. I'd avoid taking the tube though."
b'Not bad at all. There are 10 million of us living here, all but 29 of us are healthy at the last count.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s automatic she\xe2\x80\x99ll be quarantined when she comes back.'
b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t visit either San Fran or LA. Both are hubs of the virus at this point. Better to see if you can get refunded and stay home.'
b"It's really your decision whether or not to go; we can't make that call for you. But stuff to consider in that decision are how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b'Not sure if you have considered it, but I would be concerned about travel back. Countries seem to be tightening down who is being let in and out of the country. If they decide to stop letting people come in while you are out of the country you could end up stuck.  Also, just personally I think that we all have a responsibility to help mitigate the spread. Even if you no one in your immediate family has risk factors, if you were to come down with it you could still possibly spread it to other vulnerable individuals. Just some food for thought.'
b"Since you have a six month old child, I assume you are young yourself. Personal risk is low for yourself if you are otherwise healthy and extremely low for your child. If you have contact with any elderly or unhealthy, that should inform your decision. The other concern would be if whatever you're planning in SF is operating as usual.\n\nI have a 2 week trip planned to CA myself, departing Tuesday. My concerns are about travel interruptions, particularly on the return, since there is enormous uncertainty about what the status will be two weeks from now."
b'Increased severity of symptoms and increased fatality rate. It\'s a respiratory infection so pre-existing respiratory conditions increase severity.\n\nJust google "Corona Asthma" and you\'ll find several sources.'
b"I understand how much the government can enforce some of these things differ by countries, but I think the general population's tendency to stay home and not interact with each other will be similar all around the world. It's really sad if you think about it."
b'Considering how seriously the Koreans have been taking this, it might not be a month for many of us.'
b"I've spent enough time in the US to know how much things differ between Korea and the States. I feel like it's going to be so much tougher for you to deal with this :("
b">  is more concerned about controlling the information and making everything seem like it's fine instead of trying to protect\n\n... which is, 1:1, how China handled it."
b"The surgical masks won't help at all with protecting you from becoming infected from airborne viruses. It doesn't adequately filter the air you breathe.\n\nThey can help you not infect yourself by preventing you from touching your face and they can reduce the rate at which you infecting others (after you're infected).\n\nThey do very very little to actually help as a preventative measure over all.\n\nThe full-cover air filtering ones might help depending on their grade."
b"> Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.\n\nYes, completely, utterly.  But it's not just fucknut trump and his team of lackeys.  Many states and local governments are fucking things up. Why hasn't the boston marathon been cancelled? Why hasn't the st patricks day parades in boston, Chicago, and ny been cancelled?"
b'Authoritarianism governments are all about controlling information. In a democracy that information is used to control the opinions of the constituents. This is to ensure the maintenance of power over time.'
b'Because Republicans are pieces of shit bro where you been'
b"Absolutley, same in Australia. We will reach much higher numbers, I hate to think what it's going to be like in 3 months time."
b"I'd second that regarding the UK. We're going to have major problems. And when increasingly draconian measures come into play the 'I know my rights' brigade will play merry hell.  \n\nThe Cheltenham festival is being held this week. 250,000 people from the global racing world all descending on Gloucestershire and Cheltenham. It's unfathomable how this is being allowed to go ahead...."
b'My guess is that most of the cult members are done being tested, so that probably brought the number of new cases down.'

b"In fairness to SNL - it's a sketch show meant to provide stupid humor to make you laugh.\n\nThere are news outlets that haven't put out anything better than SNL has on this, and their claim to fame isn't 'D\\*ck in a Box'."
b"They won't be laughing 6-8 weeks from now..."
b"Yeah, I saw the episode and really didn't get the impression at all that they were making fun of preparations.  That Sands of Modesto sketch (which I think is the one in question) seemed to be set in a dystopian pandemic future and was just making fun of the absurdities of life then.  I guess some people don't get irony and satire and are just taking the content at face value."
b"I agree firmer approach would've been possible, but compared to other countries, I am happy with how Pres. Moon and the goverment as a whole has responded to the situation. Also, I feel the cult would've found a way to fuck things up no matter how firm our initial response was."
b"It depends on the country, but I live in one of the biggest cities in the world in Seoul and it's not THAT bad. You're taking a risk whenever you step out of the house but you can still buy food, goto reastaurants (if you want to), and do whatever if you want."
b"They obviously has worse infrastructure to deal with this stuff so I suspect it'll be devastating. At the same time, I don't think we'll be able to get any credible numbers and data about it so we'll never know for sure how bad it was :("
b'Thanks, I hope the fact that the US has much lower population density than Korea works to your benefit.'
b"Yeah, I've got friends in Daegu who's in total lockdown mode. We're not at that level yet, but feels like it could escalate any day."
b'Same me last week.'
b"I have both re-read The Stand and re-watched Contagion in the past day or so (well, I've been reading The Stand for a few weeks now...it's a long ass book...almost to the end). \n\nI loved to self-trigger myself."
b"Me too! It's oddly therapeutic.  Watching this excellent movie takes all the shapeless anxiety buzzing around in my head and gives it a narrative structure and somewhere to land.  I feel better after I watched it last night."
b"This isn't an abstract kind of recession, either.  You can see the root causes easily.\n\nA recession means a reduction in GDP.  GDP is a measure of how much business is occurring within a country.\n\nWhen people stay in the house and buy only essentials, less business occurs.  Period.  Done.  End of story.  \n\nAdjusting interest rates doesn't get at the root cause of this recession.\n\nNow, in a normal recession, different things are driving the reduction in business.  Take the commercial truck manufacturing business, for instance.  Those commercial trucks last a decade or so, and  they tend to be bought when business are growing, and replaced about ten years later (or at the end of the truck's planned service life, whatever it is).  This tends to make the demand for commercial trucks cyclical, which is rough on everyone. In this case, having lower than expected interest rates can cause a business to adjust it's scheduled fleet upgrade plans a bit, because a lower-than-usual interest rate can save them money and make them more profitable.\n\nThis is not a normal recession, though.  Interest rates have been kept abnormally low for the last few years, because the US federal reserve has faced political pressure to keep the party going.  So, they've used all of their arrows before the enemy showed up.  Plus, their usual tools aren't all that useful for addressing the root cause anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, our usual tools won't blunt the economic blow here.  But, in the USA, the land of no social-safety-net, the economy *is* linked to our individual/family survival. so we have to talk about it in conjunction with the human toll, because they are one and the same for us."
b"I'm finally getting to management level in my job just in time for the crisis of the century.  This is going to be one hell of a test since I work at a place that's expected to be open and exposed to customers through all conditions and no matter how many get sick."
b"I 100% agree with you! \n\n\nThis is me in everyday life tbh. I'm completely no stress when it comes to everything (on a side note, I don't even have an interest in learning anything about history, as it's already happened & I can't do anything about it \xf0\x9f\x98\x82)\n\n\nMy SO is pretty worried at the potential of this virus so I'm 100% on board with taking precautions - we're washing our hands more regularly (although we're pretty hygeic like that anyway), we're taking steps to avoid large groups where possible, we're using disinfectant sprays more often & we have equipped our kids with their own hand sanitizer & info on not sharing school supplies, not touching their faces, etc.\n\n\nI am not worried personally, if it comes we'll deal with it - but I'd never judge someone whose worried or play this thing down."
b'I agree, the crucial mistake people make is to forget that this is a NEW VIRUS where noone has immunity compared with the flu where most people have had it at some point or another.  The native Americans found out how devastating new diseases were when the first European settlers brought small pox to the land'
b'Actually the market likely did. The market is concerned due to a whole host of factors. Supply chain issues, economic effects of people social distancing, cancellations of events, major economic hits to travel industry etc.'
b'I think they did (in an esoteric sense). The risk to individual Americans may be low, but the systemic risk is high. The stock market is focused on systemic risks, not individual risks. This is precisely why politic talk to "soothe" the masses has done nothing to curb the market free fall. The system has every reason to panic even if individuals don\'t.'
b"Government is actually doing what they can. Mistakes were made in past years, but there's no time for complaining."
b"like they do delivery and pickup, but don't know which for about 14 days."
b'Thanks, that was what I was thinking. A friend suggested it might be a scam which had my head spinning in another direction.\n\nI will wait to hear from the travel agent.  We have flown to Ireland via LAX before so not a huge deal, although visas would need to be obtained.  \n\nWe are leaning towards cancellation at this stage. We dont particularly want to get trapped in Europe, and really dont want to expose our loved ones (specifically my elderly MIL) to anything we collect on the way.'
b'This. 70% ethanol is best. 100% drys out too quickly'
b'You would not be allowed to do so.'
b'Hamsters can be used as toilet paper, then washed and used again.'
b'I think its a German phrase for when people go and "panic shop" like a hamster filling its check pouches with seeds'
b'In german we say "Hamsterk\xc3\xa4ufe" which basically means, that people empty out supermarkets and stock up an unnecessary amount of food at home.'
b'Toilet paper is sold out everywhere for example'
b"I think it's the same as stockpiling."
b'FWIW China has not reported any deaths under the age of 10, nor has the rest of the world.'
b'"Virus just fetal to elders" \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 made me laugh \xf0\x9f\x98\x81 The fetal part. Not the fatal part. I\'m imagining old people pregnant with a baby virus.'
b'I wanted to say something along those lines, but I know my wife would chew me out for it.\n\nIt was so incredibly surreal.'
b'Has the UK tested previous flu tests against covid-19?\n\nFinland did that, and I just wonder if any other country has done so.'
b'I want to tell you what every country so far said ( Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain...)\n" Our healthcare system can handle it "\n" it is not as bad as [insert random country name] "\n" we test better than..."\n\nAll of them. Logically, not every country can be better than every others. \n\nWhat does that tell you ?'
b"Thank you. I don't know where you are, but I hope the whole world gets to be rid of this virus soon."

b'I certainly agree it would be difficult to implement.   But on 9/11, they managed to ground 4,000 aircraft in a matter of hours on a split-second decision.  That seemed like it would have been nearly impossible to implement, but they made it happen.'

b'It\xe2\x80\x99s really crazy right?? I went to a follow up doctor appointment today and the doctor shook my hand. WTF.'
b'Surely the risk alone should be enough. Hopefully they make the smart decision'
b"Yeah airlines don't offer refunds unless the situation is dire. I'd take the refund"
b'You hit it right on the head with not wanting to be the one to introduce the virus to anyone; relatives, especially. I rarely follow the news and this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on Reddit in months so I had no idea this was becoming an epidemic. I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be keeping up with this subreddit now. Thanks for the response!'
b'I just checked out that useful interactive map someone made and posted to this subreddit. Turns out there\xe2\x80\x99s a confirmed case in Manatee Cty. where my dad lives. No doubt about it \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the refund and begging him to stay indoors.'
b'Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly worried about being a carrier and possibly infecting my dad and other people. Just can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure when a case will show up by chance in my airport. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the cancellation.'
b'I agree, I think the US in particular is in for a rough ride. But if Wuhan is already coming good, that\'s gotta be a good sign right? There\'s been a few deaths, and I know this might come off as heartless, but nowhere near the apocalyptic scenario I\'ve been coming to expect. Or did China just nip it early and the rest of the world is in a "calm before the storm" phase?'
b'Perfect! Thank you!'
b'Okay thanks for the info.'
b'The UK has tested 23,513 people.'
b'do you have a source for china testing 1m/week? (not questioning, im just interested)'
b'600 thousand tests? Any source?'
b'Thanks! I have an appointment with my rheumatologist on Wednesday and I like to arm myself with as much information as possible so that I can ask better questions.'
b'Do you have a source on that?  I have never seen any breakdown of hospitalization rate by age.'
b'very bad, but atleast i\xe2\x80\x99m back in standard time so i\xe2\x80\x99m happy'
b'Res?'
b'The Philippines. So we have 2000 testing kits right now and another 4500 coming from WHO, but that\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere enough considering how densely populated Metro Manila is.'
b"Just like I had said in my comment above, if you are worried, just treat it as if you were infected.   Self-quarantine.   Treat the symptoms.  There is no cure.   If you are relatively healthy, you'll get over it like any other case of the flu."
b'Super, thank you for the quick response.'
b'I read it with more than a grain of salt. It contradicts a lot of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and heard. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no definitive proof Warner weather stops the spread of the virus yet.'
b'Fixed. Sorry :('
b">Tell them that the 2nd wave of Spanish Flu was the deadliest one. That will shut them up.\n\nIt didn't at all shut him up lmao."
b"Pretty sure if they're citizens of the UK, they'll be allowed back into their home country, but they may be quarantined there for a few weeks. IIRC it's a violation of international law to actually not allow your citizens to return."
b"Yea :( - I'm only 42 so hopefully I'll survive if it finds me.  And hopefully the virus itself doesn't do more damage than what is known so far (or potential for relapse/chronic issues).  \n\nI really appreciate what you wrote.  I read it aloud to my wife who thinks I'm being overly panicked about this (as many Americans do about other Americans who are paying attention).   \n\nStay well!"
b'Except they actually did things while making out everything is fine.   It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d while testing millions of people, shutting down cities etc and another thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d and force everyone to _act_ like everything is fine.    It\xe2\x80\x99s like the crew on the titanic refusing to lower lifeboats and telling everyone to go back to bed.'
b"Sure, but with this virus there is evidence that you are contagious before showing symptoms. \n\nSo better to assume you are infected and act accordingly if it's reasonable.\n\nThat might mean having a mask handy but not wearing it all the time; but if you already have a supply of masks there would be little reason not to wear one."
b"There's also a case to be made that surgical masks will help you from getting milder illnesses which would weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to contracting more serious illnesses."
b'Also in Australia they tell us no need for everyone to wear a mask.'
b"You'd have to be fucking mental to attend anything right now. If the govt. et al won't shut things down we need to just opt-out ourselves asap."
b"There's 317,000 church members and they're testing 10,000 people per day over there.  You might be right about that.  In which case, the drop in new cases wouldn't necessarily be reflective of the virus situation in the country at large."
b'I saw that and really appreciated it. We keep seeing official guidelines and general recommendations, but I suspect living in an area with an ongoing quarantine effort or just more social distancing affects so many little parts of everyday life.\n\nThere are so many parts of society, jobs, and routine activities that this will likely be disrupted for some time.\n\nIt must feel surreal, and maybe only more so as you get used to it.'
b'Thanks for this aspect, and everything else you\xe2\x80\x99re doing for us all. \n\nBecause of the little details I\xe2\x80\x99m now wondering what preparations I might do. Like resupplying kids craft supplies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to; and other preparations that I take so that we survive school  holidays. (New card games and board games; sports equipment; frozen meals for me coz I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted having a kid here 24hr a day;  etc.)\n\nI only just survived the Christmas holidays - I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to be unexpectedly struck down by school closures!'

b"My advice to you is every crisis is crisis of the century when you're in the middle of it. That may or may not change in retrospect, but in the moment, your job is the same no matter the size of the task. Lead from the front, look out for your people and lead with confidence, even if you don't feel it."
b'In case others are wondering how something like contact details are "mixed up".  It actually happens to me all the time.\n\nI travel frequently for work, as per company policy I have to book through our corporate travel agents, and they only accept company email addresses.  I\'m a member of a couple of Frequent Flyer programs. To take advantage of the mileage accruals, I ask the travel agency to indicate my frequent flyer number.  When they do that, the travel booking appears in my personal airline login.  Once the link is made, the airlines will notify me (via my personal email address and registered phone number) directly of any changes, seat selections, meal choices, and early check-in communications.  In fact I get more comms from airlines about my upcoming travel than I do from the travel agents.'
b"the reason 70% is used more widely than 100% is that water content helps penetrate cell membranes and walls. There is no need to use 100% ethanol, it's not more effective than 70%. \n\nsource: years of research"
b'Mix it with aloe Vera and you have hand sanitizer'
b'Seems better than the three seashell method.'

b"Don't make fun of a person who speaks broken English, that means that he knows one more.....do you jerk?"
b'It is transmitted in the incubation period.'
b'I mean, that was a specific, already highly-regulated industry, not literally everyone & everything. Not a great comparison.'
b'First of all: will there be flights to get there?\n\nSecondly: will there be enough officials and volunteers?\n\nThird: will people not from Japan want to take the risk to travel there and maybe get stuck in quarantine.'
b'Good choice! I wish you and your family well.'
b'China had an extremely aggressive response, which most of the rest of the world will not be able/willing to match.'
b"The problem is China can completely control their citizens so even though the botched the beginning they could stop everything in key places. Western governments won't have it so easy"
b'Yes, https://www.biocentury.com/article/304545/who-china-makes-and-deploys-1-6-million-covid-19-tests-week-the-u-s-is-just-starting-to-ramp-up-capacity\n\nactually WHO said China now test up to 1.6 million cases per week, more than I mentioned above.\n\nActually, if you are from Japan, Korea, Iran, Italy, you will be tested upon arrival airports in some cities in China for free, and receive the results no later than two days, since you are not suspect case, and if you have fever, your result will be returned within hours'
b'holy crap he\xe2\x80\x99s right\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51747932\n\nI had NO IDEA that india was doing that much testing !!!\n\nedit: reading the actual article it says that this \xe2\x80\x9ctesting\xe2\x80\x9d is taking place in airports, and it also mentions airport screening.\n\nSo is it screening (like a temperature test) or is it covid19 testing??\n\nedit2: okay this link says that as of march 7, a total of 3,404 people have been tested\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/niv-scientists-working-round-the-clock-to-ensure-smooth-coronavirus-testing-across-country/articleshow/74536078.cms\n\nso i think that the first bbc link is reporting airport screenings. i am not sure what those consist of but it seems to be different from a covid19 test.'
b'It was light out till 6:30 today! So happy to see that. I hope this is the last time we have to change our clocks in BC.'
b"Reddit Enhancement Suite, it's a browser plugin."
b'I imagine the main concern for you guys is people without health insurance will not want to present themselves for treatment for fear of ridiculous costs. Prob the only 1st world country where people have to prioritse money over thier health. Hopefully your govt provides funding in some way.'
b"It's more than just us surviving though, the big concern is if we catch it then pass it onto other people who have much worse chances of survival."
b"To be fair, they are correct. Most people have no idea how to properly use masks, to the degree where random Europeans or Americans suddenly deciding to use masks will probably **increase** their odds of getting infected. There's a lot of issues regarding to how to equip/unequip masks (i.e. you have a high chance of infecting yourself if you touch the front parts of a long-worn mask), the fact that most masks aren't meant to be used more than a few hours, and will end up accumulating bacteria / infectious particles when used for days, etc etc etc.\n\nConversely, the people who should be using masks are those already infected, because here the primary purpose is to reduce the amount of infectious droplets leaving their mouse/nose. (Technically, they could even wear the same mask for multiple days, because anything they use and wear will be contaminated anyways...)\n\nSo, if the government flat-out issues statements of 'don't rush and buy all the masks and start spamming their use', that's actually legitimate (if not very explanatory) advice."
b"Not saying you're wrong, but as of right now those issues are all out of my control. I hope the amazing people trying hard to come up with the cure/vaccine succeed sooner than later, and everyone around me takes basic precautions like washing hands and wearing masks. But for me and my family, we're just trying to survive this mess without contacting the virus and not go out of our mind from not being able to live like we used to."
b'Lol calm down dude. Korea is handling this exceptionally well, their rate of new cases is actually declining. The same can be said of China, which is starting to re-open schools. Source: https://twitter.com/business/status/1236877340615081984'
b'Bit of a reach to just assume those things are 100% going to happen'
b'Be well John Spartan.'
b'a Hamster is the small rodent in german as well. Hamesterk\xc3\xa4ufe means, that people a stocking up like a hamster, because hamster store their food in their cheeks'
b"Actually, I do. I speak 3. I grew up in a multi lingual country. And their comment made smile. I wasn't making fun of them.  \n\nPeople mistake words for one another all the time.  Native English speakers do it too. And then there's autocorrect humor - which is literally all about mistakes. \n\nIf you grew up a multi lingual collectivist society or at least watched movies made for such an environment, you would notice that jokes about language are a natural part of the system. My comment is offensive when you're not used to this. I'm guessing you're not."
b'Thanks!'
b'that would be amazing'
b'Yeah, but as you stated, the main benefit of wearing a mask is that people that are infected spread fewer infectious germs. So it makes absolutely sense for everyone to wear one (assuming enough are available), since nobody knows if they are infected and might be spreading corona'
b"Very cute expression. I love it.\n\nAlso very relieved to hear Germans don't eat hamsters. :)"

b"As bad as the Chinese govie messed up at least they are making an effort to help. They would be within the right to say fuck you pay us. So I am in no way a Chinese govie cheerleader but if you don't give props where props(carrot) are due then the stick you get later has no real meaning.\n\nWe should be encouraging China by not always looking down our noses and treating the people with respect. I was deeply saddened to hear Asian Americans (I assume from all countries as my fellow American is on average pretty racist/ ignorant apparently) that they were buying guns for protection from other Americans due to Covid-19 attacks.(I didn't hear of any attacks but the one guy that got beat up) \n\nNot trying to veer into politics so forgive me if I crossed that line but we need to be encouraging of all countries to be honest about their responses to this so that we can learn. The good the bad and the ugly. 1918 SF had a lot of things we can draw from but it was a different world then and almost impossible to think of all the ways those differences affect(effect?) Current global economy, goods transfer both physical and digital(since wfh is being ramped up) even education and resource allocation. Hell even the population density/locations have changed in big ways in some cases. Say Detroit vs Seattle (assuming that back in the day Seattle was not quite so packed I'm only mid 30's so I don't really remember very far). This data matters and yeah we got shit data to start but if I remember correctly the Chinese people are very proud and it shows in the govie. Japan is much the same. Here in America we are shocked at Japanese officials apologizing for late trains..Money is a big motivator but it's not the only one so let's capitalize on the opportunity to improve the world for everyone. \n\nNo I don't expect China to stop the awful stuff but how much can we really bad mouth them with the shit American govie does to not only our own but others.....our track record isn't clear and I think we should clean our own house while we are busy pointing fingers elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear this isn't a demo vs repub thing or a pro/anti (fill-in the blank president) this is learning to look past country flaws and see humans as humans and not enemies."

b'Globalisation more or less means embracing global trade. Inevitably, companies will purchase labour as cheaply as they can get it and people will work for those companies if it provides a better life than they had before.'
b'You are absolutely correct but at the same time you completely miss the big picture. \n\n1. Poor people escape malnutrition and huger into  cities. They live in slums and scavenge landfills if nothing else.  China for example has almost eradicated hunger  but it still exists in some places in countryside. \n2. People in sweatshops are one step above people in absolute poverty in  countryside, streets and landfills.  \n3. Poor people in developed countries lose their jobs to people in developing countries. \n4. Net effect is better living standards overall even for the poor, but poor are always doomed to worse conditions in everywhere. \n\nGlobalization is net benefit for the humanity and it works trough magic of comparative advantage.  The adverse effects of globalization come from governments not reducing inequality within their countries or having global standards that mitigate  adverse effects.'
b"Ironically I think the end result of globalization, after it envelopes more and more facets of everyone's lives over time, is the eradication of sweat shops and realization of workers' rights for all. It's just a mud and blood entrenched trail to get there. It's inevitable."
b"I'd love to see how many Americans can afford $40 t-shirts produced in the USA. I'm also pretty sure most Americans *don't want* the jobs that have been sent to other countries. 14 hour shifts at insanely demanding and monotonous manufacturing jobs that pay peanuts? The only people that live here who want those jobs are immigrants that anti-globalists want to get rid of. Can you imagine how much all of this technology we're addicted to would cost at US wages?\n\nPoorer countries absolutely need better labor standards, and US companies that are outsourcing should be more picky with their suppliers and use leverage to ensure they don't end up with factories in their supply chain with suicide nets or textile plants that are on the verge of collapse. That said, we aren't getting away from globalism unless we resign ourselves to a much lower quality of life. 95% of Americans couldn't afford a smartphone if it was produced in the US."
b"This. I'm still cynical somewhat about the CCP but not every Chinese person tows the official line. Stuff like this serves a reminder that each chinese is a person before a communist, and that no matter what you think of a government, the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI think this is a beautiful act from a company and can further strengthen relations in the future once this is done by. How we treat our neighbours, especially when it's under control within our own borders, may play a big part in how people see us in the future"
b'Lol only on Reddit do I see constant boot licking for China... thinking...'
b'The whole reason we are in this mess is because Chinese government ignored the warnings of the doctors in wuhan who were warning them that it will be bad, for like two months... and not only ignoring them but not allowing them to speak to media etc. to say oh maybe you should wash your hands more and not go outside as much.'
b"Well both respect and shame them on how they've handled it. They did build hospitals and were effective. However they silenced it at the start, witch might have lead to a bigger problem than if they just admitted at the start"
b"It's a country that is good at dealing with big numbers while we have very few eccellenze, as they say in Italy."
b"Hey I'm good with the quarantine urgency, just not how they could have snipped this in the bud at the start but instead went and silenced people. Then again western is shaping up to not really do much better, just fail differently."

b"Makes sense if you think it's going to spread everywhere soon. Prevents other countries from buying up your stock and leaving your own country with less. Of course it has all sorts of secondary effects and it'll probably end up in some EU court in a few years after this all blows over."
b'Credit to the Japanese. It\'s one of the only things I find heart-warming about this terrible disaster. Someone needs to repost it to r/HumansBeingBros .\n\nNow, Chinese people followed this fashion and donated masks to other countries with quotes from their own classic literature. \n\nMy favorite ones are: to Daegu, Korea: "the roads cannot estrange people, there\'s no border between human beings", by Choe Chiwon, a Korean scholar who studied in China during the 9th century; to Iran: "The children of Adam are the members of each other, who are in their creation from the same essence. When day and age hurt one of these members, other members will be left (with) no serenity. If you are unsympathetic to the misery of others, it is not right that they should call you a human being", a famous quote from Saadi.'
b"I'm told that Chinese who live in Japan made this idea from the beginning. But I don't have strong resource to proof this point, just wanna say what you heard might not be the truth. Anyway, the result is people in Italy who need masks now have more supplies."
b'Can you elaborate on that, what did the japanese do?'

b"> Inevitably, companies will purchase labour as cheaply as they can get it\n\nInveitably? That's the sole goal of any company wherever. To produce as cheaply as possible while selling for the maximum possible profit."
b'This is all true but you have to remember some people don\xe2\x80\x99t care if there is more suffering in China and would welcome it.'
b"You must have taken an economics course at some point or ran into some libertarian ideology and didn't look to closely. \n\nYou point to the positive and ignore the negative. You see people in poor countries get a little richer and ignore people in rich countries getting poorer. You believe in a linear direction for all countries; only ever better and richer. But that is not the world we live in. If things were getting better [deaths of despair](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html) would not be a thing. The formerly rich fall further down than the formerly poor rise up. This is a necessary fact, otherwise the job would not be outsourced in the first place.\n\nYou also put too much stock into the comparative advantage argument. This argument assumes that all competition is only between people and not between people and machines, it assumes that there are always needs to be fulfilled, and it assumes that people will always be able to make enough money to cover their basic needs allowing for, you know, survival. None of these assumptions hold in the real world.\n\nIn the real world a machine would compete with the human, the value of labor can drop below what the human needs for survival and another death of despair would happen. The machine will only get better over time."
b"You are more optimistic than me. So far what I see is the power of unions being undermined and a race to the bottom for work conditions. And I don't believe in the 'it needs to get worse before it gets better' mantra.\n\nLet's agree to disagree."
b'Why is communist such a bad word for you? China is state capitalist-private ownership but state direction. The only communist country I know of is Israel with its communes or a they call them Kibbutzes.'
b'> , the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI can understand paying less attention to your government when your living situation as a citizen is improving so quickly that your income doubles every few years. While you still remember living in poverty when you where young. You just want them to keep doing what they are doing.\n\nThis certainly doesnt mean that the international community should let the Chinese Government get away with their crimes though.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s your excuse in the West to run around like headless rats?'
b'Exactly - had they been transparent about what was going on, and addressed doctors concerns instead of silencing and arresting them, maybe they wouldn\'t have needed such draconian measures afterward to try to combat the virus.\n\nWith total control of information going in or out, though, I would be very reluctant to "respect" anything they\'ve done there.  I don\'t think the US is making the right moves re: quarantine, but I don\'t think throwing anyone who so much as looks sick into the back of a white van to be "quarantined" against their will is any better.'

b"The quote that went along with the donations from Japan to China was actually used more than a thousand years ago during Chinese Tang Dynasty when, for the sake of communicating the knowledge of Buddha, Japanese authority made and sent thousands of Buddha gowns to Chinese monks, and all the gowns were embroidered with kanji \xe5\xb1\xb1\xe5\xb7\x9d\xe5\xbc\x82\xe5\x9f\x9f \xe9\xa3\x8e\xe9\x9b\xa8\xe5\x90\x8c\xe5\xa4\xa9, which roughly means mountains and rivers on different lands, wind and rain under the same sky.

b"I made a similar comment a while ago about my Redmi Note 7 Pro and also got one or two people saying that I was an ad bot, it's really a bit silly as they are genuinely very good phones and most people seem to just not even consider them and are willing to pay twice the price for the same specs just because they are a chinese company and they associate chinese products with bad quality or something like that. You can basically get the specs of a \xc2\xa3500-\xc2\xa3600 phone (by one of the mainstream manufacturers) for something like \xc2\xa3200-\xc2\xa3300 with no real downsides. One of the things about them is that they all have very impressive cameras on them often similar to the expensive flagship phones.\n\nSome people complain that the phones all have built in ads and bloatware but I personally don't get any ads with the default Chinese MIUI firmware. Obviously English is a language option and after installing the Google apps it's basically just like any other normal phone."

b"That's my point."
b"The value of labor was always going to drop as soon as we got machines. Labor isn't as valuable an asset as it was 50 years ago, that's why it's easier to ship it off to third world countries where it is a bit more valued. That's why higher education and training is important, clinging to dying industries and denigrating globalization is meaningless."
b'My take: The end of "globalization" (as defined 3 comments above) will happen when automation takes over - when AI and machinery become more advanced and cost-efficient than a human laborer. \n\nBut it\'s gonna come with its own set of issues, looking at the Mouse Utopia experiment.'
b"I agree with you wholeheartedly.  This incentivizes poor conditions for workers.  You're going to let unions demand better conditions?  OK, say goodbye to your industry.  We're moving all of our orders to the Banana Republic of Tropico, where workers are whipped if they don't work at least 12 hours a day for 6 pennies and lodging in a cardboard box.  That's the *practical* reality of globalization."
b"Any union that exists now is a nationalist or fascist union if we are to follow a truly communist or socialist society.\n\nIf you think your local union is a good thing its only a good thing for people that are near you or look like you.

b"Of course. I think we need to question our relationship with the CCp after this is done. However, Chinese citizens themselves aren't responsible and we must ensure that anything we do doesn't have further implications for them. They don't deserve this. Perhaps we'll even see political change in other nations, who knows."
b"True, but when we have Americans stranded on a ship off our shore because he's unwilling to take the temporary jump in cases - it very much is about him.\n\n..and the apparent lack of the 5th grade education required to understand exponential growth and how paltry those numbers will look in another week or so."

b'When have politicians ever made sincere apologies?'
b"Japan has never officialy comment on the massacre in Nanjing China, nor the victims of human experiment by the 731 unit. Rather, they deny the existence of these events, and was never incoporated into their history textbook. They even teach it in class as 'an effort to modernize Great East Asia'.\n\nThe list of claimed 'apologies' are also contradicted by their acts towards war criminals, who they fuckin enshrine and visit yearly. I am afraid that TWO official 'apologies' that are later clarified by 'nope we did not do that' plus a cabinet stroll to a criminal shrines does not compose into a sincere apology."

b'>I assume the difference between Ecclesiastical Latin and Classical Latin lies in things like "v" being pronounced "v" or "w" and such?\n\nIt\'s a bit more than that. Ecclesiastical Latin follows Italian pronunciation, so things like ce/ci become che/chi, like when you hear him say \'\'pace\'\' as \'\'pache\'\'. He also said \'\'ma**g**ister\'\' as in \'\'jacket\'\'. Ecclesiastical Latin is an artificial pronunciation created by the church.   \n\n\nIn Classical Latin c is always /k/, therefore \'\'pace\'\' would be pronounced \'\'pake\'\', and the g is always a hard /g/ as in \'\'ghost\'\', therefore, magister would be pronounced differently. You also have a 3rd pronunciation called scientific Latin, which is 99% Classical except for the V, which is pronounced just like in Ecclesiastical to differentiate it from the vowel U.  \n\n\nPersonally, I dislike Ecclesiastical Latin as it sounds horrible to pronounce Latin like that.'

I\'ve been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria...there is little I haven\'t been exposed to in my profession. And with notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared.\n\nI am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.\n\nWhat I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they " probably don\'t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know..." and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess.\n\nI am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you even  \nimagine?\n\nI\'m scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession.\n\nBut mostly, I\'m scared about what message we are telling our kids when faced with a threat. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.\n\nCovid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it. Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and "fight for yourself above all else" attitude could prove disastrous.\n\nI implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let\'s meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.\n\nFacts not fear. Clean hands. Open hearts.  \nOur children will thank us for it.'
b"Except it's not a Pandemic... A quick google search verifies that this is not the case.   \n\n\nAs defined, a Pandemic is a disease prevalent over a whole country or the world. Prevalent meaning widespread.  \n\n\nSo, a disease that is widespread over an entire country, or all over the world. Yes, there are clusters of cases in different countries, but it is far from being wide spread over the entire countries, and definitely not widespread over the entire world.  \n\n\nIs Cancer a Pandemic? Is AIDS a pandemic? Is the Common Cold a Pandemic? No, and neither is the Coronavirus."
b'Lol CNN. If anything, this is gonna make people take it less serious. This is CNN we are talking about here.'
b'1 guy has the Coronavirus where I live'
b'CNN: "We are the journawhores and require attention so we will call this a pandemic because it\'s never too much of hysteria, and we would roast Trump if he try to soothe the panic".'
b"Every day we go without martial law is a mistake. We need decisive action and leadership right f'n now"
b'Pandemic has no official definition, and each government agency can define it how that like.\n\nThe term was even retired a few years ago and replaced, i forget the replacement name.\n\nIf CNN wants to use the term pandemic it can. I will just keep calling it \xe2\x80\x9cbatshitcrazydemic\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b'WHy is this tagged World and not US? CNN is US state media'
b'Wonderful, so now what? Stop attempting to make the news and just report it.'
b'You know people are panicking when they give so much power to a meaningless word/classification. This changes nothing.'
b'They love fear'
b'So the WHO website states a pandemic is \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a large portion of the world population is infected\xe2\x80\x9d. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but with a world population of ~7.75 billion, and ~116,000 cases confirmed, 0.0015% of the population is not \xe2\x80\x9ca large portion of the world population\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nEven for the US Population of ~328 million, 565 cases is 0.00017% of the population. That\xe2\x80\x99s even LESS than the world % infected rate.\n\nThis is fear mongering, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be scaring people, we should be informing them........'

b'I thought it was called a pandemic much earlier than that. The moment it left China it basically was a pandemic based on the definition.'
b"You've literally just copied the top Twitter reply, outstanding work"
b'Who cannot use the term "pandemic" because there is no definition in this sense in their procedures. They are now referring to the event as "a major global emergency". Basically, it\'s just semantics.\n\nRegarding CNN... They are right to use the layman term "pandemic" but let\'s not kid ourselves: they DO have ulterior motives. The administration\'s response was abysmal, so underlining the severity of the situation and posting it against the ineptitude of the authorities is a very direct way of injuring the GOP. Don\'t get me wrong, the essence is right in what CNN is doing and reporting, but I have a reasonable doubt that their approach would have been similar had the US had a Democratic administration.'

b'> Stop voting for the lesser evil, this is exactly where we are as a result.\n\n\nI thought the current administration got voted in to "drain the swamp?" \nStop voting for sound bytes.'
b'Seems like a lot of smoke and mirrors. Like everyone is quick to judge China on their medical care but most of the states can\xe2\x80\x99t even afford to visit a doctor once or until they are forced to. This is going to get so much worse'
b"Sorry but your world view is very US-centric.... you just think you have the best of everything.  Kind of egotistical to believe the US is the best at everything.   The US doesn't rank on/at the top of lists for best health care, and you aren't on the top list for the national technical strength."

b'The current administration made its goal to defund and dismantle the federal government including the CDC. Voters got exactly what they voted for.'
b'Please avoid off-topic political discussions.\n\nOur policy on political posts is as follows:\n\nThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it.

News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned.'
b'The attitude of "stop voting for the lesser evil" regardless of if the person is evil or not is literally what gets us the worst evil. If we vote for a third party and not Hillary, we fucking end up with Trump.

Tell me how Nader and Stein worked out for us in the other timeline.'
b"Congress just approved $8 billion in funding to fight this.  Some of that funding is going towards a vaccine that they hope to make available in a year or so free of charge.

b'Not the best pitch for MFA.'
b'I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t think people will stop trying to contain it with it being called pandemic.'
b'Yes well, the USA seems to think this is nothing but the flu. Maybe they need to be scared a little bit because it\xe2\x80\x99s very apparent they are unaware to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on outside of the USA. And I\xe2\x80\x99m an American saying this. I knew this was going to go down like this here.'
b'I get that that\xe2\x80\x99s their take now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fucking stupid one to be honest. Underselling the threat has only exacerbated the problem again and again. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a pandemic, and I doubt countries are just going to give up now if it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d. If anything it would drive them to take containment and other measures seriously. Maybe they should try actually providing guidance and information instead of playing games and being as cryptic as possible.'
b"Yes, That's what I took from the WHO announcement. Its so politicans and people won't give up containment. No one knows what the virus can do, better be on the safe side."
b'Also world bank bonds.'

b'According to stats around 10% of Covid patients need intensive care, mostly because they need machines to breathe/keep them alive. A friend of mine works in a medium sized hospital. She stated they had oxygen at every hospital bed, but only around 30 respiratory support machines. And just 4 of those machines that mix oxygen into your blood directly if your lungs are shutting down completely.  She is psychiatrist, but they are getting crash courses to care for patients with SARS, freeing beds, postponing all non urgent treatments and are preparing the psychiatric ward for Corona patients.\n\nShe said, they have no covid cases yet, but when those 30 ICU beds are full, they will have to decide who lives and who will slowly suffocate to death. She is really scared and stressed. There are no covid deaths in Germany yet, but if the ICUs are full, death toll will ramp up just like in northern Italy. \n\nAnd that\'s the main reason progress must be slowed. We only have a limited number of hospitals, doctors, nurses and ICUs.\n\nEdit: The psych ward beds are no hospital beds and don\'t have oxygen of course. But they would be in charge for non-compliant "less cooperative" infected patients (drug them and restrain) and for terminally ill patients / palliative care for patients sorted out due to triage. "We are not allowed to kill patients. I mean, you put your dog to sleep if he is beyond recovery to do him a last favour, but we aren\'t allowed to do that. People with SARS and without ventilation will slowly suffocate to death. I have been told to think about a way to medicate them to ease their suffering and panic, but my medication can not be the cause of their death. By god, if it was me I would tell them to OD me morphines, but no, I have to suffocate myself to death, like drowning in slow motion. Because law...I can\'t be your cause of death. Nature has to be. Your death has to be aaaaall natural, no added chemicals..."\n\nShe\'s getting really cynical. I have never seen her like that. She is venting to me. I am scared shirtless and can\'t sleep. But for her it has to be ten times worse so I listen.'
b'1. Reduce the strain on emergency care systems (hospitals).\n2. Try to reduce overlap with current seasonal influenza.\n3. Gain more time to study the virus and possible countermeasures, e.g. antiviral medication, better identification of cases, etc.'

b'Same'
b'Epidemic is local sustained transmission, pandemic is global as I understand it.'
b"According to *your number*, covid-19 is 20x deadlier than the flu, at 0.1% mortality rate.  The flu does not land 10-20% of infected in the hospital for weeks, either.  The US has over 550 cases, and the only people getting tested are those with heavy symptoms and travel history.  *Nurses on the front line* can't get tested.  So if 80% of infected are too mild to get tested, that means about 2750 people are actually infected, and spreading.\n\nRational thinkers aren't worried about mass graves--we're looking at health care and services getting overwhelmed."

b'Do you know what respiratory means? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a hint: it has to do with a fucking important organ system you fucking idiot'
b"I'm not worried much for myself. I'm young and relatively healthy. I'll almost certainly be fine even if I get it. But it can and has been deadly for older populations and those with weaker immune systems (think cancer patients undergoing chemo and HIV positive patients). And it could be real bad for those that already have lung issues such as COPD. \n\nBut it's also a novel form of respiratory virus. We don't know everything about it and it is spreading and spreading fast. We don't need to outright panic, but we need to take it seriously - even if you aren't part of the most susceptible populations you should be taking precautions to protect yourself so that you don't pass it on to them."
b'I think something everyone needs to learn is how to know the difference between taking something seriously and going into a panic. If people are told to take something seriously, too many jump to "stop trying to scare me and make me panic!" That\'s not always the goal.'
b"Wait until the virus starts popping up in nearby cities and counties, then people are going to really listen. I've seen the sentiment at my workplace, live in Oregon, go from it's fine it's less than a cold just cover up and wash hands, to I'm only going out as needed. It's only been alittle over a week since our first case back at the end of February, this friday will be 2 weeks so I anticipate more to come."
b'"Even on Reddit"\n\nHave you used a website before? Reddit REALLY isn\'t much different than Yahoo Answers.'
b"People I've talked to are either not too worried about it or think the media is too alarmist and I'm too wound up about it. \n\nAlready had a few coworkers come in sick, more than one with a respiratory sickness. Americans aren't taking this seriously enough and I fear in the next 1-2 weeks shit will get bad."
b'In Italy two weeks ago the majority of people claimed media for being too alarmist...\xe2\x80\x9dit\xe2\x80\x99s just a flu\xe2\x80\x9d...'
b'Half of America will say it is "fake news" by the lametream media aimed at discrediting Trump and influence the election. \n\nThe other half will claim that Trump\'s denial of it being a pandemic proves he is unfit to lead.'
b'[removed]'
b"People should shit on CNN for it. *Which* definition of pandemic are they using? Certainly none advocated by the CDC or the WHO. All CNN is doing is engaging in fear mongering by *incorrectly* labeling something, in direct tension with the world's *leading experts*. It's a disgrace to journalism."
b"people shit on cnn about this because its politically driven, they're only doing this to bring down the republican party, and are spreading false information about stopping the virus."
b"It's hilarious that the WHO still hasn't declared it a pandemic. At this point they shouldn't even bother; it'll only draw attention to the fact that they missed the boat by a country mile."
b'I think it requires uncontrolled spread in at least two regions, so not the moment it left china but once it broke out hard in europe, yeah.'
b'The moment there was local transmission out of East Asia.'
b"> based on the definition\n\nI find it truly irritating when an organization like the WHO does not manage to use the existing definition. It's actually not open for debate. It's not up to opinions or views. It is what it is. Period."
b'Haha pure coincidence believe it or not! Let\xe2\x80\x99s be real - it\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing that came to all of our minds'
b'Maybe they are the same person.'
b'Who cares!...oh right. You do.'
b"Congrats. You figured out that reddit is not the front page of the internet finally by showing some skepticism. There is very little original content on \\\\r. But that's not to say that this quote is copied. It is not hard to think identical thoughts."
b'Lmaoo'
b"You don't knows that"
b"> had the US had a Democratic administration\n\nThen this move wouldn't have mattered because a Dem president might have come out and said it was a pandemic, or at least not spread actual misinformation about it"
b'The approach would have been no different dude.'
b'WHO cannot use the word pandemic because they removed it from their procedures.'
b'facts, 7o% AlChoHol KillS ThE ViRUs!!!!!'
b'Might have to find some new candidates for 2020 as well.'
b"I mean, a Ferrari is (one of) the best car on the planet but it's also expensive. The US does have the best medical system it's just one of the least available/accessible because of the health insurance industry."
b"Well that's what we're told, I have always been frighteningly aware it's not."
b'I am soooo tired of the status quo.'
b"The swamp is being exposed on a regular basis & people are being removed.  It just doesn't happen overnight, especially getting the rest of the population to see the light despite negative coverage from your political rivals 24/7."
b"The US isn't on the top list for health care because we have a bunch of people who have none.  Toss a bunch of zeros into any data set and you lower the number significantly.  The US is a bunch of haves and have nots.  If you're a have, then you're just fine.  If you're not, then you're fucked.  There is a reason why people come to the US when they need top notch medical treatment though."
b"Quitting what we're told, I know better, have for quite some time."
b"This always heralds back to an ancient marketing strategy - one still used to this day.\n\nWhen you're #1, you claim to be better than all others.\n\nWhen you're #2+, you claim to be better than #1.\n\nIt's the strange irony that everyone uses the United States as *the* measuring stick, especially when, as you put it, we're not on/at the top for X, or even on the top list for Y."
b"We don't rank at the top of the lists because of healthcare availability is low. The quality of our doctors is among the world's best, that's why many good doctors from other countries come to practice in the US. Where we fail is getting access to care to the general public."
b"Keep reminding us buddy, I'm sure it will stay that way indefinitely if you *just keep reminding us.*"
b"Without the US the rest of the turds in the world would be speaking Russian,German or Japanese. So no matter what your opinion of the US is , you're welcome. As for your list of rank in different areas, whatever most of the damn countries lie about most of the shit on those list. Hopefully after this election Trump will start cutting out the foreign aid & military aid  and then the turds can stand on their own two feet."
b"I'm with ya, my mother has gone into hiding up in the back woods of Maine, they have months worth of food, in a cabin with very very little interaction, sister will bring them what they need.\n\nThank god mom's partner is a survivalist, he knew exactly what to do."
b'VOTE COVID-19 2020\n\n/dark humor'
b'Lmfao'
b'Nope. In the third world, unless you have money, the best you can hope for is a bed to die on while your family brings you your meals. The Republicans are trying to gives us a 3rd world medical system.'
b'My neighbor who is all Trump Trump Trump, 64 diabetic with a heart problem, just got off one of the cruise ships in Florida that now they think was contaminated. Says "Trump will fix this, he will get control" from a safe distance I had to just roll my eyes.\n\nI sure hope he\'s going to be ok, I mean he is a nice guy, even if we don\'t agree on politics.\n\nIt\'s a bitter pill but yes, your right.'
b'Not to nitpick, but a lot of it is also because of people just simply refusing to vote'
b'I meant to just stop voting for evil period... I always hear "well looks like I\'m voting for the lesser evil" fuck that find what\'s right and good, stick to it.'
b"What's about to happen in America as a result of this is about politics, strong leaders would not fail us in a time of crisis. By fail us I directly point a finger at limiting testing, denying science and pursing ignorence."
b'We\'re supposed to be a free country, it\'s frustrating to see people unable to even get tests because "they don\'t fit the criteria" our healthcare system is about to be utterly smashed to bits. I\'m angry and pissed off, this is not supposed to be how America does things.\n\nSurgeon general: I see nobody unable to get tests\nCDC: don\'t test unless under a certain criteria\nFucking CNN has to do what the CDC and WHO should have done\n\nMoney money money it\'s all about money people are dying, or parents and grandparents are dying.\n\nBeen watching this close since mid January, I didn\'t think USA would respond so goddamned poorly, but here we are.'
b'Politicians might. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the WHOs own guidelines don\xe2\x80\x99t call for containment measures anymore at stage 5 or 6 pandemics. They don\xe2\x80\x99t preclude them either, they just say it\xe2\x80\x99s up to individual governments at that stage.'
b"It'd be a logical decision from a resource allocation perspective. It's expensive to screen all incoming international traffic. If there was no point anymore then it might be better to switch to more testing and more internal isolation. ie:- Instead of airport blocks, quarantines on a suburb level."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m with you. Anyone paying attention should\xe2\x80\x99ve known this is what was going to happen here. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been told I\xe2\x80\x99m overreacting etc but I\xe2\x80\x99m not panicked about the virus.  Viruses have been around since the primordial soup. I\xe2\x80\x99m panicked about the current administration. A narcissistic reality tv show anti science idiot and a pray the gay away HIV outbreak causing anti science religious bible thumper do not have the tools to stop this.'
b"I am honestly surprised to see the MAGA reaction. I shouldn't be because I have followed the rise of the Qanon cult, but despite that obvious evidence, I didn't realize how deep the denial of reality would go."
b"I had to show my dad Flu vs Covid morality rates for his age range..\n\nFox news has him believing it is literally only as deadly as the flu.  He didn't understand the orders of magnitude difference of mortality rate until we did some napkin math..."
b'One can only imagine the sort of debates going on in there. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s all very, very political. \n\nThat said, they ARE providing loads of guidance and information, and are coordinating the countermeasures to and sharing of information about the outbreak globally. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the CDC, ECDC or Chinese CDC driving this, it\xe2\x80\x99s the WHO.'
b'I\'m not sure enough people know about this. The 100 million in type B bonds for sure gets used up. There is another 300 million in type A bonds that might get used. Millionaires and banks might lose their gambling money if WHO says "pandemic." couldn\'t let that happen'
b'Hey it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect example of Fascism Sign #8\n\n>\tThe enemy is both strong and weak. \xe2\x80\x9cBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The best president! /s'
b'What'
b"Do you know what exponential growth means? In case you don't I'll put it in words for you. \n\nEvery 6 days the amount of infected people multiplies by 10. give it 2 weeks and it has multiplied by 100, 3 weeks and it has multiplied by 1000. In a month thats 10000.\n\nLooks pretty scary to me."
b'The problem with being too dumb to realize how stupid you are, is that you think the people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t as dumb are the stupid ones. Pro tip: the experts in the field aren\xe2\x80\x99t the dumb ones here.'
b'When should we call it? \n\nAlso, these \xe2\x80\x9cidiots\xe2\x80\x9d are doctors and scientists who have studied viruses their whole life.\n\nTell me more how you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert in this please.'
b'Pandemic Phase 6: Community-level outbreaks are in at least one additional country in a different WHO region from phase 5. A global pandemic is under way.'
b'To add in, if the curve goes above the capacity line, a lot more people start dying. The longer the curve is above the capacity line, the more people die. \n\nA simple scenario is that hospitals run out of spare ventilators. People who could be saved with this support (including people who are sick for other reasons) would die in that case.\n\n(I think New York State has around 5,000 ventilators in regular use, with around 1,500 in storage for emergencies. Going by 20% of people getting sick needing vents, all that spare capacity gets eaten up if less than 10,000 people get sick at once.)'
b'I hate that this is the image that\'s going around. Hubei\'s healthcare system was overwhelmed at less than 1% of cases, doing a bit of simple math reveals that every other healthcare system in the world gets overwhelmed somewhere between 0.1% and 1% cases. So if you\'re going to draw this graph, draw it with the peak 20 - 50x higher and the "best case" scenario being the healthcare system overwhelmed for a full year.\n\nThe only solution is to bend the R0 curve down severely so at most 1% of your population gets infected. The Chinese themselves said every 5 days of inaction, your situation gets 3x worse. You can say "China lies" all you want but if you\'re not even willing to accept the truthful stuff coming out of China, what use is there even to China lying?'
b'We need people like her speaking out to those in charge both politically and those that run medical facilities, as well as to the general public. \n\nIt might be too late, but if only we could start building emergency facilities as well as getting American factories to ramp up creation of ventilators and things for repertory health!'
b'Got a link? That\xe2\x80\x99s Fucking outrages'
b"You're going to need to source that one."
b'Came here to same the same. Great minds think alike?\n\nAnyway, the term pandemic does not indicate severity in detail. We are definitely in pandemic land now, but there still have been more severe pandemics in the past (according to what we know AT THIS TIME about covid 19).\n\nSource: [Doctor Explains How to Prepare for a Pandemic (WIRED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr1aXn8_F3I)'
b'There are 117000 affected people over the course of 3 months over the WHOLE world, with most of them being in china. Is that an exceptionaly high proportion of the population? Are you fucking serious right now?'
b'How is 0.0015% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population an exceptionally high proportion of the population?'
b'[deleted]'
b"To be fair, they're being played by like 10 different groups with as many different reasons for terrifying the public."
b'Yep. Very good observation. People here are definitely way over the top. Which I find entertaining.'
b'I have zero doubt that this will absolutely blow up in the US, but using the term pandemic is not correct right now.'
b'3000 deaths on a planet with 7.5 billion people. 98% survival rate. Bodies are not piling up. It\xe2\x80\x99s a respiratory virus. Chances are if you get it you won\xe2\x80\x99t even know it and it won\xe2\x80\x99t feel different than any cold.'
b'[deleted]'
b'What are you so worried about? This shit isn\xe2\x80\x99t serious. It\xe2\x80\x99s death. It is common. /s'
b'"It\'s but a flesh wound."'
b'You ever had the common cold? A cough? That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what this is. You can be a coward and live in fear and buy into media propaganda all you want. They\xe2\x80\x99ll take your money. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Spanish flu or bubonic plague. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the fucking idiot?'
b"Exactly. There's a huge gap between being well informed and making precautions, and sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is okay. Calling it a pandemic is not 'alarmist'. Informing people about the virus and its effects around the world is not 'alarmist'. But too many people would rather just plug their ears."
b'Honestly I thought the same thing, untill my brother and his wife decided to spontaneously take a trip to San Francisco this weekend. Ya know, the city with the Grand Princess? They sent me pictures and thought it was funny. His wife is an ER nurse.'

b"Depends on the sub really. Some subs are really niche and it's not very Yahoo Answers. As Reddits really become more popular in the past couple years, the general subs have gotten much more Yahoo Answers.\n\nr/Coronavirus just has already reached the point where it's attracting more of the Yahoo Answers crowd."
b"My more conspiracy minded acquaintances claim the whole thing is made up. It's just a bad cold being turned into something more so the government can seize power, companies can sell the eventual vaccine, rich people can make money using it to manipulate the stock market, and/or the Left is using it to steal the election from Trump. \n\n(Note these are not all conservatives. Liberal conspiracists tend to see it as stock market manipulation while the conservative ones see it as a political attack)."
b"People need to take it seriously but not panic. If you get it, wear a mask to prevent it from spreading airborn(if possible, not fully caught up on it) and have consistent hand washing. It's not the worst thing that could hit but it's definitely not a good thing or something minor."
b"> Trump's denial of it being a pandemic\n\nTrump's not the one denying that it's a pandemic - the CDC/WHO are. Trump is saying it's just a cold and that like a miracle, it'll disappear before April."
b"The definition is pretty straight forward. I'm not sure why more people aren't using the term pandemic."
b'they have the former surgeon general'
b"i mean... if it fits the definition of a pandemic i trust that it's a pandemic..."
b'Please be civil and respectful. Insulting other users, racism, and low effort toxicity are not allowed in comments or posts.'
b"[The WHO isn't even following their own definition.](https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/pandemic_phase_descriptions_and_actions.pdf)\n\nThe document was originally crafted for pandemic influenza but the principles are the same.

b'Could you backup the false information claim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not doubting you just interested'
b'Around Feb 22nd, cases numbers in Italy went up uncontrollably. That was the start of the pandemic.'

b'Hi do you have any examples on who he has removed so far, to drain the swamp?'
b">The swamp is being exposed on a regular basis & people are being removed.\n\nI'm confused, who has been removed? The swamp has only gotten murkier by the presence of Trump and his entourage. I'm not sure how you can really say that."

b'Except he brought in his that are corrupt to run or in some cases purposefully mismanage those departments. But facts are irrelevant to you'
b'Was discussing this with our trauma attending Saturday. She summed it up concisely: access, quality, cost. Prioritize one, the others suffer. \n\nUS: prioritizes quality.

b'You do realize they make more money, with ALIVE people right?'
b'Stop making this a political issue when its clearly not.'
b"It's 100% because accepting reality would make Trump look bad.\n\nCan you imagine what they would be saying now if Obama was president?

b'I just wonder how Q-anon goes from recommending bleach as a cure-all to flat out denying its a problem.'
b"What rates did you use? Because while results I've found indicate it COULD be higher, they vary dramatically, and seem wildly unreliable."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I followed the last part there; what is the \xe2\x80\x98this\xe2\x80\x99 that the WHO is driving?'
b"The pandemic bonds have nothing to do with what the WHO calls it. There are specific criteria based on spread and deaths in countries. They haven't paid out because none of the eligible countries (all developing nations) have sufficient deaths yet.\n\nAnd frankly, the pandemic bonds are absolute peanuts compared to how much the markets have been shedding."

b'Or he might just be a troll.'
b"> To add in, if the curve goes above the capacity line, a lot more people start dying.\n\nThey don't just die from COVID-19. They start dying of completely unrelated things because manpower and equipment is tied up dealing with the infected."
b'A lot of hospitals have shut down in recent years. Maybe some of these should be reopened on an emergency basis?  Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia comes to mind. I am sure there are others.'
b'There are no numbers on the pic for a reason I think. It brings across a very simple message in a REALLY easy to understand way\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0and I think that is a huge achievement and exactly what we need. Also, if you\xe2\x80\x98d make it more scary, people would start resisting the message. Some people invest a lot of emotional eneergy right now so that they don\xe2\x80\x98t need to be afraid\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 and no matter what you think of that, you still need their cooperation to, well, flatten the curve.'
b"I don't understand your criticism. This conveys the current strategy to prevent the current healthcare system being overwhelmed. The goal is slow the rate of case build up. \n\nIs your point that there is no hope and that everything is doom and gloom?"
b"Thank you. People seem to think that there's about 2 *million* on earth. A few thousand is the smallest drop in the bucket imaginable"
b'I think you e confused yourself. He is saying cnn making it a pandemic will make it less credible. I am saying that his satire post was perfectly impersonating someone who solely watches Fox News and Sean Hannity.\n\nThe trump voter that already thinks Cnn fakenews will see this as an attempt at \xe2\x80\x9cdems trying to cause coronavirus fear\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the accurate classification that it is. \n\nAka his original comment is valid: the more people believe it\xe2\x80\x99s just fear mongering dems, whether what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is true or false, the less serious a large portion of the population will treat the virus.'

b'>You ever had the common cold? A cough? That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what this is.\n\nYou should really read the reports of some infected.\n\nThere was a "mild" case report from Italy, he wrote about feeling like drowning for over a week. He said it was hell on earth and he did\'t get admitted to hospital because he wasn\'t severe enough.\n\nYes there are a lot of people for whom it really is "just like a common cold", they make up 50% to 80% of cases.

b'Are the CDC and WHO truly independent?\n\nSerious question.'
b"He's probably mixing a few things he's heard. There are two strains of coronavirus that are endemic and cause seasonal colds. And for most people COVID-19 will just be a mild or moderate chest cold. \n\nColds, including coronavirus ones, do seem to be seasonal so it may well die down this summer -- but then reappear in the Fall. It also might not be seasonal, we won't know until this summer. \n\nIf it is seasonal that gives us a chance to stop it. Widespread testing and isolation of people who might catch it during the summer could stop it. But I suspect it has spread to countries that can't or won't do that and we'll get the strain again from somewhere like India or Nigeria or South Africa. Or even the US."

b'CNN Has also edited the skin colors of some US candidates (specifically Bernie Sanders) to make them look less appealing on screen and decrease their popularity.

b'I\'m sure these things are being considered (as well as using lots of other spaces temporarily for non-critical patients), all of which will push the "capacity line" up, but we\'ll still hard limits on other things, like health care workers (who can get sick, too), vents, supplies, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that epidemics are on an exponential growth curve, while health care resources are at best linear.'
b'Except all the worry about not being extreme enough has done is made people complacent about the upcoming risk. \n\nThis is the same logic as the messaging around "We\'re going to tell people mask are completely useless because if they realize they actually help, we\'re going to run out of them."\n\nIntentionally lying to your populace about easily verifiable information is corrosive to the public trust necessary to get us through the next epidemic.'
b'The area under the curve is equal in both scenarios which implies that we can gain a lot by simply slowing down the rate of infection. Given that the peak of the curve is just 2x above capacity, this feels like a doable, high impact intervention.\n\nThe reality is, with uncontrolled spread, the peak is going to be 20 - 50x above capacity and spreading it out more is merely going to bring it down to 5 - 10x above capacity for a whole year or more. The highest impact intervention we have now is to *reduce* the peak, not delay it. If we delay without reducing, everyone is gonna have a lot worse of a time than this pretty graph implies.'
b"Can you imagine how many asymptomatic people are carrying the virus right now? How many people that haven't been tested? You'd have to be a fool to believe that only 110,000 people are infected right now. The Iranian government is downplaying everything connected to the virus, scientists and researchers agree there is no way only 7,110 people are infected and 237 have died, calculations and analysis show there are probably around 20,000 thousand people infected and deaths most likely in the thousands.

b'CNN is not nearly as left leaning as people think. They also did a shit ton to protect the bush administration. Their problem is not that they are politically motivated, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they are profit motivated and they are lazy. They never do investigative reporting and rarely take an editorialized stance on anything. They do surface level reporting as fast as possible, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fact check, they figure out whatever narrative will make them to most money and they go with it. \n\nOnly with the Trump impeachment have I seen them start to take any sort of stance on politics as opposed to just quickly showing both sides as if they\xe2\x80\x99re even, but they still had plenty of trump defenders on even though they would grill them much more harshly. However this was a rarity and the thing that conservatives never realize is liberals hate cnn just as much as the right does. \n\nYou have news outlets like the New York Times, MSNBC, and, to a much lesser extent, NPR which are all much more left leaning than CNN but they are all much more trustworthy news outlets in the sense of if they are reporting something then it\xe2\x80\x99s much less likely to be a false or non impactful story. Their skew just comes from which accurate stories they choose to run. \n\nPeople who analyze the trustworthiness and political leanings is different news outlets always put CNN as moderately untrustworthy but centrist.'

Maybe "only" 2% will die or maybe even only 0.5% will die. Those deaths will be sad, but they will not be the real problem. Having 10% of all infected in need of an ICU can bring any health system to a collapse, if the infections cannot be contained.\n\nTelling Corona is "harmless" and "just a flu" leads to people not taking it serious and that leads to less containment.'
b'i didnt ask'
b'>someone has to take care of these people\n\nIs this the broken window fallacy?'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. First, there is plenty of data on the WHO website, although most of it is Influenza-related. That\xe2\x80\x99s the pandemic everyone was waiting for. Not that people weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting or planning for an outbreak of a novel virus, there\xe2\x80\x99s been plans for that too - but it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to plan, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know in advance what kind of virus it will be and how it will behave. SARS-CoV-2 is a nastier one (in terms of contagiousness versus mortality) than most assumptions would\xe2\x80\x99ve been previously. \n\nAnd that said, the influenza documentation still provides plenty of useful information for the current situation, just not always 1-to-1 applicable. \n\nSecond, as with any transnational governing body, it leaves public exposure mostly to the member states, ie the ones with the higher (democratic) legitimacy. By nature, it must work mostly behind the scenes, coordinating (but not dictating) policy, and streamlining information flows between countries. \n\nAnd of course, specific measures must be different from place to place - even within countries. But there is a large similarity in responses - just look at the travel advice almost all countries are giving now. Italy has gone for the Wuhan model in response to it\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak in Lombardy. Most other European countries follow the initial Italian response. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s party due to coordination from the ECDC, but they in turn coordinate with WHO.'
b'I said what my point was multiple times in that text..'
b'Chances are if your wife, friends, parents & siblings *all* got it they still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die. Pandemics happen. People do get sick and do die but freaking out about it isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping anyone.'
b"First,i dont even technically considered a broken window fallacy. But regardless No, because the money spent by the retirees or their caretakers is USED to employ someone else. Older people naturally get sick, how many nurses, doctors, hospice, and other various caretakers do you think currently make their living on the fact the elderly simply EXIST and need care? They feed their families with that income, kids go to school. I dont see how the BWF applies. It does not make sense for a fully developed capitalist nation to shoot itself in the foot by eliminating the elderly, in ANY way. That's like killing the sick and making healthcare workers unemployed...guys, it's not that hard to understand."
b'Thanks for humoring me, I agree it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m inherently a skeptic, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t tend to believe something is happening unless I see proof. But it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible the WHO has been coordinating behind the scenes and most countries are just choosing to ignore them.'
b'Chances are if my aging parents got it, they have a very real risk of premature death.\n\nMy dude, an aversion to potentially lethal infectious diseases is a natural and vital instinct. You are trying to stigmatize a rational alarmist reaction as \xe2\x80\x9cfreaking out\xe2\x80\x9d. Failure of this instinct can put you and your community in an avoidable life or death situation.\n\nArrogance and ignorance on a massive scale will be the leading cause of death in this pandemic, same as the Spanish flu. Our society is so sheltered that we think we\xe2\x80\x99re immune to things like plagues, famines, and natural disasters. It\xe2\x80\x99s causing us to ignore our natural instincts and stigmatize people with a totally normal reaction. We will see much death that could\xe2\x80\x99ve been easily avoided had we taken action two months ago. As usual, our hubris is our downfall.'
b"If those old rich people died their money would still be used, hopefully for something more useful.  It's not like their money would disappear."
b'On the contrary, they\xe2\x80\x99re being applied. Just compare the COVID19 guidelines issued by the CDC and the ECDC. Different formats, but suspiciously similar language. Which points to both those documents being wrappers around WHO guidelines. \n\nAgain, implementation on the ground can (and should) be different, depending on where the epidemic is in that specific region. Wait for Wuhan- and Lombardy style quarantines to come to a country near you. It really is a matter of time.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not being arrogant. You should be aware just not overly concerned. Wash your hands, go about your life. What else can you do? Worst case scenario 2% of the worlds pop dies from this. Highly unlikely. It will be widespread, a vaccine will be developed, herd immunity will be gained, life will go on. \n    The biggest danger and threat to life is from socioeconomic collapse from people overreacting.'
b"> The biggest danger and threat to life is from socioeconomic collapse from people overreacting.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d get massive economic trouble just from automation replacing truck drivers. Happy thoughts isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to avoid that in context of 2% dying. Not by a long shot.\n\nAt least with panic and concern we can urge preventive measures to lower the death toll. Eye rolling \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just a flu. It\xe2\x80\x99s just 2%. It\xe2\x80\x99s just your kid you can make more. What was your grandma doing to help stimulate the economy anyway.

The party will simply threaten to pull all support from the politician's next election if they don't vote along party lines.  Only a few politicians have the actual political clout among the electorate to embolden them to vote freely (e.g. Mitt Romney, John McCain).  In practice the republican party is far more guilty of this than the democratic party."

b'I work in a package sorting facility. And they told us today if were sick stay home. But I really doubt any of us working there can afford to take time off. Plus there is no insurance or anything, so we cant afford to go to the doctors. No sick time yet. Were taking precautions like gloves and washing hands, keeping an eye on our hubs and infected cities....But Idk.....We sort and send packages all over america......sketches me out thinking about how fast a sick person coming in carrying it could spread it'
b'Employees PLEASE stay home if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick. We have paid sick leave and our employees still regularly come to work while sick. The other day my coworker looked so pale. Was coughing and sneezing. Put his coat on in the building (very out of character for him) which makes me think he had the chills and maybe a fever. \n\nThe next day another coworker developed a nasty cough. Now the girl that sits next to me texted me today saying she\xe2\x80\x99s got a bad cough and fever. Luckily she has the brains to call off sick.'
b'Why not just put it into law.  Two weeks paid sick leave a year would cover most cases.  It\xe2\x80\x99d help stop the spread of the flu I suspect,not just Coronavirus.'

b'Reading all these comments as a European who has actual functioning sick leave systems and safety nets that allow these kind of things is frightening...\n\nAmericans are basically screwed.\n\nI can call in sick right now and get paid for the first 7 days of my sick leave from my employer.\n\nAfter those 7 days the government takes over paying my sick days for the next 7 days at 100% my wage.\n\nAnd even after those combined 2 weeks i still have sick leave but it falls to 85% of my wage paid out.'

b'Heres how this is going to shake out\n\nEvery american employer is going to send down a pretty little announcement or email from the top "taking the pandemic very seriously and working with the public health department" yadda yadda. They will say "If you\'re sick, please stay home and look after your health" - maybe comment on how pandemics are only contained by how strong the public is at looking after themselves.\n\nAnd that\'s it. When nobody goes home because it\'s either work your shitty job for your shitty pay or not make rent, a lot of moral rules get bent.\n\nAnd then after that, when infections continue to exponentially climb, company execs will just shrug and say they did the best they could.'
b'Good luck with that. Sick days in America are looked as you can\xe2\x80\x99t come in to make us money. Too many days off equals goodbye.'
b"Most won't.  They'll insist their workers work until they are literally gasping for breath.  Workers are replaceable, they aren't worth investing money in."

The issue is testing. We all need to be tested before we pass it to someone else. What will happen is that I'll stay home sick with coronavirus but everyone I've been around will have been exposed and the they will have to stay home sick from work. This cycle will continue.\n\nAnyone that thinks they will just not catch this is disillusioned."
b'Employers can\xe2\x80\x99t support this if it crashes their cash flow.  There are breaking points.  Businesses are not endless money buckets that can afford to pay lots of people while they are shut down, when their customers are cancelling orders or avoiding new purchases.  When they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cash to pay the mortgage, utilities, invoices for inventory,  they also can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the wages.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of what they want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they can do.

b'Exactly what symptoms should we be looking out for? I saw one thing say runny nose, sore throat, fever, and cough, somewhere else just said cough and fever'
b"Basically what should happen is this. If you test positive for Corona from a verified doctor, then the government must enforce you don't go to work for 14 days and pay you for those days."
b"It's insane that the government has to ask nicely for employers to comply with this overly polite request.

b"I worked an entire shift with a 104\xc2\xb0 fever when I was a bartender,  because I didn't have a choice.  We bartenders ran the whole bar alone, and were not allowed to call in sick. We did not get PTO or sick leave...if we wanted time off, we got someone to cover for us and we didn't get paid for it.  \n\nNo one was willing to cover for me last minute (fever came on suddenly) and if I didn't show up I could have been fired. Fortunately for me, I now work for a company with PTO,  but sadly there are many people in my situation. \n\nPS - I didn't have anything contagious, but an EMT customer took one look at me, asked me if I'd checked my temperature, and told me to go to the ER...which I did, after work."
b"That's on the employers."
b"This advice is so vague as to be almost useless.\n\n- Is he saying that you should stay home if you show **any** symptoms of fever/cough/flu at all, regardless of severity? \n- Has any arrangements been made to deal with the impact of removing a substantial portion of the working population if this policy is implemented? I'm thinking of unintended consequences- like the closure of schools in Japan leading to the reduction of medical staff who have to stay home to babysit their kids.\n- How is this supposed to work? Do you just phone your boss and tell him you're taking time off? I see **that** working out well.\n\nThe way these ad-hoc advice is being released by the current administration is... not confidence inspiring."
b"I've been waiting for something from my work offering extended sick time to cover it if we get it. The other day they just posted something that basically just said stay home if you're sick and had us redo our food safety quizzes. I have about a week of sick pay. After that, I can't really be out of work. So I guess we'll see what happens."
b'Thats funny as too they will not respect it and people will point out and get fired.'
b"How sick is sick enough? I've got a bit of sniffles and a very very slight cough. Do i quarantine?"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m driving to work now with a nasty cold/possible flu because we are desperately short on staff (nurse). Bring on the surgical masks and non-stop handwashing and keeping my fingers crossed charge or management sends me home. Can\xe2\x80\x99t stay home when patients are coming in 24/7'
b'let me rephrase this a bit: Employer, if you do not support this you are a fucking moron.'
b"Great advice except., if I miss more than 3 days I am required to have a Doctor's note.  \n\nSince you can't get tested no Doctor is going to write me a note saying I can't come to work for 2+ weeks to not spread the Virus if I get it.  (assuming my symptoms are fairly mild)\n\nNot to mention my job doesn't give sick days so I wouldn't get paid."
b"Unless the federal government gives employers money to pay people with, you won't see massive PTO increases.\n\nMost American businesses are small, and can't afford PTO under normal circumstances, let alone with reduced income.  Google US small business statistics sba for more info.\n\nThings aren't too bad yet, I'm already dealing with some Corona virus related problems with my small business.  If we get mandatory closures without some sort of financial assistance, a lot of Americans will be jobless because their jobs won't exist anymore."

b'The CDC\xc2\xa0said that so far this season, 34 million people have gotten\xc2\xa0the flu,\xc2\xa0and about 20,000 have died....so yeah.'
b"My employer just gave all employees an additional five paid sick days for the year, to make sure we don't come in sick. If you have to be quarantined beyond that, you can use short-term disability to keep getting paid. I'm super lucky to work for an employee-owned business, though."
b'HAHAHHAHAHAHA!\n\nMy wife came down with a horrible respiratory infection here in the US (PNW). Her parents and I took her to the hospital stat.\n\nThe nurse fucked up her IV and she ended up dripping blood on the ground and in tears: she still has the purple stains from the blood leaked under her skin. Either way, at least she got her medicine. \n\nShe is a type-1 diabetic. That shit is fucking genetic, so if you have any comments about "Americans fat, you deserve diabetes" save \'em: you can shove them up your fucking ass and get fucked. \n\nOur state has recently enacted mandatory paid sick-leave, one of the very few in the whole nation to have this. Within the local context, that means shit however. Every time a law like this is passed, shitty businesses find a way to pass the tab on to their workers or straight up defy it. A seafood processor gave their employees (mostly immigrants) a letter saying "while the state has passed X law, our company policy is different".\n\nHer workplace policy is that you need to be gone MORE THAN 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS to be able to apply, because of course, you have to apply and it is up to them to come up with reasons why they can\'t give it to you. Those of you who are smart, noticed that this is basically 8 consecutive days instead. She gets sick on sunday, spends all week recovering, on sunday she is ok-ish, but her sick-leave policy does not apply since it wasn\'t 5 consecutive work days or more. She just lost over 1500 dollars in income, and her nice government insurance still left her with a 500 dollar co-pay (thank fucking god, that is cheap around here). \n\nShe is a professional who works for the state government btw. \n\nImagine the poor dude working at a warehouse or at the airport polishing floors? \n\nThose people are going to die and do so while in medical debt. Funerals around here start at about 7000 for a crap casket and a video/slideshow of your miserable life in bad resolution-pictures.\n\nSo yeah, that dude is disconnected from reality when asking people to stay at home.'
b'They can try but companies don\xe2\x80\x99t have an endless reserve of savings.  Some are living AR to AR and using lines of credit to finance working capital.     Little businesses are going to get crushed by this. While they should have enough money to cover any normal PTO and Vacation, beyond that, it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the bank accounts to run dry.  Some will do better than others but I suspect like most Americans, most companies are living paycheck to paycheck. I have do idea about the cash reserves of publicly traded companies, but SMBs will burn up pretty quick. \n\nTo put in perspective:  26m companies in the USA. Only around 20k are publicly traded. 95% are 3 employees and less than $500k/yr.   I tiny fraction of companies have gross revenues in excess of $1m/yr.  \n\nSMBs employ the bulk of the workforce.  \n\nThis is going to be very painful economically.   But if we don\xe2\x80\x99t pull together and slow this down, the health care system will be overwhelmed and there will be needless death.   \n\nThis is a national emergency.   We should start acting like it.  \n\nIf you are still reading this, you are the resistance.  Social distancing NOW.'

b"Who goes to work sick? My boss would send me home immediately if I came to work sick - although it never occurred to me to go to work sick. If I have a cold I stay home for a week instead of infecting my colleagues.\n\nUsually it's like this: you're sick, you call the company and say you're sick, then you go to the doctor (usually your family doctor) and get a confirmation. This confirmation does not contain the exact diagnosis, because this is a private matter and does not concern the employer. Later you give this medical confirmation to the employer, usually by email. You come back to work when you are healthy, no matter how long it takes.  You will receive full pay (including bonuses) as long as you are sick, even if you are sick for months - but a doctor must confirm this. The company must pay the full wage for between 6 and 12 weeks, depending on how long you work already at this company, then half the wage for 4 weeks.  The state health insurance company then pays the rest, so you always get 100% of the salary you would get without illness.\n\nIn order to relax and to be less at risk of falling ill, holidays are very important. Statutory holiday (vacation days) entitlement is 5 weeks per year (people who have worked more than 26 years are entitled to 6 weeks), fully paid, of course.  On top of that there is an extra monthly salary, which is tax-privileged. So you get a more than two monthly salaries during vacation (for Christmas there is an additional monthly salary extra). On top of that, there are 13 public holidays for which the normal salary is also paid, unless they fall on a Sunday. If I get sick during my vacation days, this is no longer counted as vacation days, but as sick leave - which means that I can make up for this vacation days later.\n\nIf you are prevented from working, you are entitled to full pay for a maximum of one week, depending on the case, but you are obliged to avoid being prevented from working if possible. Typical cases of incapacitation would be:\n\nVisit to the doctor (only if the doctor is only open during your working hours or in case of acute pain), own wedding, death and funeral or wedding of a close relative, witness in court, no travel to the place of work due to natural disasters, moving house, birth of a child (for the father, mothers are not allowed to work for 8 weeks before the birth date anyway, but get this paid by the state health insurance).\n\nNone of this is a special performance of the company, but is required by law for the whole country - every company has to handle it this way. Trump and FOX call this socialism.\n\nAmericans, change your system, the current one exploits you."

b"When I started where I'm working now back in 2008, they had unlimited sick leave. I was like what? That is unheard of. Their mentality back then was that if people would really stay home when they were sick and that policy had been in place for a long time. Then a couple of years ago they ended it because a bunch of people abused the policy and stayed home sick for weeks at a time when they weren't sick. They still give us 12 days of sick days off which is still unbelievable but it's a use or lose policy and now a bunch of people suddenly get sick in December right before it resets."

If they close work? Fucked. \n\nNo one wants to go to work sick or spread it or anything, we just have such an absolute shit country that only cares about corporations and the wealthy. It puts you in an awful place. Potentially spread something you might have and risk other people? Or stay home and 100% lose everything you have because you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to miss work.'
b'My Fiancee and I found out recently it is cheaper for us to be on separate healthcare plans, which sucks, especially with what mine covers it would be more helpful to her. While I was looking at the cost of that I saw what my premiums would be for family coverage, that alone was like "yep, that is financial no to children".'
b'I totally understand this. I am so lucky to have sick pay. I took some unpaid time after my child was born and it took us months to catch up on our finances.'
b'Get your group together and go to HR. Tell HR that they either send the sick lady home **now** or all of you are calling out sick **now**.'
b'"Democrats introduce.." RIP that bill.'
b'Sadly they never say what bill it is.\n\nIs it this one?\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1185/all-info\n\nIt seems not right though. That makes basically a flu sick leave office and administration overhead. Not the simple solution the hill is talking about.'
b'The easy way to ensure this passes is to make the tax breaks these companies get every year dependent upon them offering the 2 weeks paid.  It\xe2\x80\x99s at least a way to get the lobbyists out of the way.'
b'The scary word might fix the problem >!democratic socialism !<'
b"What is the most admirable creature on God's green Earth? Why, it's the bee! Have you ever seen a bee on vacation? Have you ever seen a bee take a sick day? Well, my friends, the answer is no! So I say, be\xe2\x80\xa6 the bee! Be the bee!"
b'TBF, the bill is actually "let employees accrue 7 days paid sick time" AND make an additional 14 days available immediately during health emergencies.\n\nSo assuming you had already accrued 7 days, you would have those to use for those other things. (But I still totally agree even with 7 extra it\'s not enough)'
b'Or actually gets the virus or gets quarantined again.'
b"Well hopefully that's what happens.\n\nIf people start getting sick and can't get hospital treatment without paying for it or get clean water or food then the 327 million people living in the USA, many of whom are armed with serious guns won't care about a bailout or the stock market or money or banks."
b"Here in Germany, you're required to have a doctor's note to utilize a paid sick day. (Which is also a lot easier because doctor's visits of this nature are completely covered by insurance.)"
b"Why are these bullshit excuses always used for the US can't do something but they never stopped any of the countries that have these things and have had them for decades?"
b'There are tons of ways to curb the potential abuse of this. Regardless, all else equal, I think possible abuse of power should be given to the workers rather than the employers. Employers have been abusing the system for decades through poor pay, poor benefits, etc.'
b"It's not supposed to be a comparison.  It's a slippery slope joke..."
b"Employers with low wage workers don't give a shit if they die, they can be replaced in 5 minutes."
b">He's saying that paid sick leave saves the employer money in the long run\n\nAnd that right there is the problem, companies do not care about the long run, they care about next quarter."
b'And you are interacting with customers, or at least surfaces customers touch. That is why COVID-19 will spread very fast in USA.'
b'> If I have 4 call offs in 6 months im fired.\n\nthats actually illegal. So the official reason for firing will be different.'
b"It's nothing special. I am from another European country, and here you always get 100% of the salary (and bonus) as long as you are sick - no matter how long it takes. And that is up to you and your doctor, not the company. That is the law, all companies have to act according to it. This is a matter of course for most western, rich countries (well, except the USA)."
b'Europeans: What are hospital/medical/doctor bills? Never seen one.\n\nAmericans, you need to change your system.'
b"Wage theft is higher than *all* property in USA. We need local state and federal government to create good laws like paud sck leave for all companies with more than somany works - and the actually *enforce* those laws. \n\nAlso see article s in how it's enforcement has continuously dropped for high income will ramping up on poor and low income .."
b'I need a cigarette'
b"ok well thats not your fault, they should hire more people. If they are struggling then higher ups deal with the problem not the ''team'' or you. This is why i got out of those warehouse jobs. Slimey fucking business but stable money."
b'Yep, work in a factory and when someone calls in sick manager somehow expects me to be able to do same amount of work without that person somehow lol...then again I called in sick more than my coworkers haha'
b"OH cool, then spread the illness to everyone. That's much better."
b'Only with a cherry on top \xf0\x9f\x8d\x92'
b"I am sure that because they used this majic word, employeer will make sure to jump at the chances to do as asked. The truth is, we are profit 1st and everything else is second so no matter how it's asked, it will be ignored unless it benefits the corporation"
b'The family that works together shares illnesses together! T-thats how the saying goes, right?'
b'How disgusting is that?! They want sick people serving other people food and getting the customers sick too just so they can turn a profit.'
b'Well not if 20% of the country is dying'
b">Oh, not t\n\nyes the freedom to walk into management's office with covid-19 and start coughing.. 'MERICA  FUCK YEAH!"
b'Honestly, I am surprised that freedom is much better back home in Europe than here. Well, besides the freedom of having a gun, yes, that one is much stronger here.\n\nBut it kind of clicks when you realize its perfectly legal to open carry a gun here, but you can get in trouble for open carrying a can of beer on the street.'
b'Risky for whom? GDP per capita in the European welfare states is comparable to that of the USA. So, who would lose if the US were to better protect the broad masses of ordinary workers?'
b'Long story short, our HR is not very good at being HR'
b"My kids school sent out an email that everyone needs to download an app, and get familiar with it in case they cancel in-person classes and move to online only. \n\nAnd for those who don't have internet access, they somehow have plans to enlist the help of one of our public broadcast TV stations, and will be giving lessons and homework on there, with a hotline set up for students/families with questions on schoolwork.  \n\nI'm quite impressed. I hope more schools/districts are doing this."
b'Can you imagine how fast this will spread in an Elementary school?!? Just stomach bugs travel fast.. This would be horrible.'
b'Like what?'
b'U.K. is the European version of the USA. All for the 1% at the top and - because Europe - for the 10% at the bottom. Who pays on top is the middle class, who now turn crazy people into premiers.'
b'Damn I\'ve worked at my company 12 years and get 4 weeks and 5 "sick days" that are included in those 4 weeks. Haha'
b'Same here. Job advertised 21 PTO, sick days and holidays. I was like "Oh wow, 21 vacation days, and sick days, and holidays? That\'s amazing." Even mentioned it to the recruiter and she didn\'t say anything.\n\nGot into the job, realized ALL of it is pushed into one pile. I\'m forced to take time off for like Christmas or Thanksgiving, even if I don\'t want to and it all comes out of my pool. It\'s all accrued and on the same schedule.\n\n21 days is "generous" for most Americans, but I felt lied to and it really soured my first couple of weeks at this job that really never got much better.'
b'yeah americans should get at minimum 14 days a year off regardless. Times are rough right now and most of us are working alot of hours to make ends meet'
b'Man the biggest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt from this is how crap sick pay is in the USA. Here in the UK my last 2 jobs I\xe2\x80\x99ve had 6 months full pay, 6 months half for sick leave, plus 30 days holiday + bank holidays PTO. \n\nAre you guys alright? I think you need a Bernie revolution hard over there or something haha'
b'My company has both, but anytime you are sick, the first 16 hrs comes out of PTO.... so many people wont call in.'
b'Your employer/insurance plan does not offer short/long term disability time?'
b'What state are you in now... ?'
b'Sounds like this would have beena situation where Short term disability insurance might have been helpful. Does your company offer that as a benefit?'
b'If I get sick on my holiday, that day does not count as a holiday day.\n\nAll of Sweden is like that.\n\nThe US is just totally fucked up.'
b'Yeah ours just takes it out of our pto pool'
b"It's not huge. It's lower than mandatory PTO in most countries."
b'Does PTO in your case lump in sick days as well?\n\n\nAnd I also assume that weekends are not counted as PTO?'
b"I'm guessing you work an office job.\n\nLets see what food service does (not) do and watch how dangerous that will be."
b"Fingers crossed my company goes this route. Currently they use are PTO if we call in. Its 14 days of quarantine if you get the coronavirus,  I work 5 days a week, I don't want to waste 10 days of my PTO."
b'A lot of people are hospitalized for weeks though'
b"My work is a desk job FOR a major US city with some of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases. I had a terrible cold last week and asked my employer if I could work from home, so I didn't alarm my colleagues with my cough. They said no and I had to come into work all week. Oh, and I'm 32 weeks pregnant."
b"Honestly, they should have said if anyone try's coming into work  exhibiting symptoms, they'll be fired."
b'Can you source that please? Happy cake day btw.'
b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one good thing about this eventual pandemic (and of course, it will be a singular island of a good thing amidst a vast sea of awful), it\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility it will wake the rest of America up to the notion that our workplace standards (compensated sick leave being rare, health insurance tied to employment, etc) are uniquely terrible and need reform.'
b'im screwed if i get sick'
b'Man every time I get sick all I can hear is my one manager going "well if your realllly sick you can stay home".'
b'I work through illness. From home. Where I can\xe2\x80\x99t spread my disease.\n\nMost colds don\xe2\x80\x99t knock you out from being able to do work. That still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should go spread it around.'
b"Because you're not a team player or serious about the job and someone will get promoted over you. Oh you shouldn't take much FMLA off either cuz else you look bad. Said by my own dad.\n\nSeriously fuck the boomers and Puritans who arrived here and started pressing witches in a few decades."
b'I would have to say it\'s a bit of both.  In my line of work, you are given paid time off, but are highly discouraged from using it ("take your vacation when you are in your lay off period." -manager), which of course leads to co-workers ragging on even taking a single day for sick or pleasure.  It\'s some machismo bullshit.'
b'Great point bc coming/going to work sick is a social mind set  bc folks dn want to risk the social opprobrium   they might get by staying at home!'
b"We have no limit on paid sick days and a very relaxed work from home policy, we still come in sick. There's definitely still a stigma or a mindset that unless you're bedridden you should be at work that's clearly very pervasive in our culture."
b"I know my dad is in this group. Some will go to work sick because if they use their PTO they will fall behind on certain projects, miss deadlines, etc that may cause them more stress anyway, so they'd rather just work through it. He only uses his PTO during times work is slow and he can go on a vacation or something."
b'my husband is a union electrician. he has zero PTO. if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. if his company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a project for him, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. his company was already slow and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a place to go for this week. \n\nwe live in a major US city, and i predict in the next few weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on some kind of shut down. and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way in hell his company or the union is giving any PTO. i have no idea what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.'
b'Ironically, the place I work at is a union shop.  Most of these union people complain about being overworked but still support politicians that want to destroy unions and roll back protections for laborers.'
b"I guess I'm that Euroweenie that left America for those handouts. Oh well!"
b"Exactly! If you are with an illness, and you can't afford healthcare, it simply means you didn't work hard enough and you deserve to die, those lazy drains of society."
b"Anyone blaming the individual with no other option than to do what's best for their livelihood is foolish. The fault lies in the system, and they will reap what they've sown when they put people in this 'awful place.'\n\nBest of luck to you friend."
b'Now that we have a child, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had paychecks so small before, even though I make $6 more an hour than when I started this job.'
b"A coworker already said something (he has lung cancer so he is not playing around), and my husband will be talking to his boss to ask if he can just work from home to minimize the risk for himself and us here at home (am very pregnant...I really don't want this while pregnant or while recovering postpartum). I haven't heard an update yet since he's working but I'm sure I will later."
b'Thanks to that asshole Mitch McConnell. At least let\xe2\x80\x99s put the blame where it is deserved'
b'Im a fiscal conservative, id support this bill.'
b'No such thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s just capitalism with generous safety social net.'
b"It's gonna require a smarter, better educated population.  Too many people literally cannot distinguish between countries like France and Sweden, and countries like Venezuela and North Korea."
b'Now outlaw insecticides.'
b'That old guy on the princess cruise ship is still carrying the virus after 21 days! Chinese had to extend quarantine to 28 days after discovering some people still registering as infected post symptom stage. All it takes is a few people who are infected after a massive quarantine to cause a resurgence all over again. If we do create a vaccine in 18 months, it will be a world record in fastest vaccine ever created by humanity. After its creation, they will not have 7 billion vaccines instantly on hand either. Expect this virus to be around for a while, maybe forever like certain other viruses.'
b'Or has children that show symptoms after them and will also need care and supervision while at home.'
b'You describe the US as it already is.'
b"> If people start getting sick and can't get hospital treatment without paying for it or get clean water or food\n\nIsn't that reality for millions of Americans already?"
b'That is literally already happening.'
b'*serious guns*\n\nYou owe me a coffee'
b"trying to get a doctor's note here in the us right now,  might be kind of tough.   i personally don't go to the doctor everytime i feel under the weather,  and i would suspect a ton of other people are in the same boat.   also if im sick,  (...not deatlhy sick), the last thing i want to do i drag my butt out if bed and sit in a doctor's office."
b"That's still unreasonable if you have to do that for even just 1 or 2 days. If I have a migraine, I can't even safely take myself to a doctor. I may not even be able to speak or compose an intelligible email for a while. Moreover, the doctor can't do anything but tell me to get the fuck back home and rest.\n\nForcing a doctor's visit and note just infantilizes the working adult population, waste's the doctor's time, and at best prevents the sick person from resting and puts them in contact with people sick with other things."
b"We get a bill well over a hundred dollars for a basic doctor visit here in the states. That's with insurance. This makes it near impossible for low income people to get in to a clinic to get a doctors note. Now, you lose out on wages AND have to pay to see a doctor."
b"Depends on the employer though. With most you can take 3 sick days in a row before you need a doctor's note."
b"A doctor's note would cost me $200 :("
b'>state and federal government\n\nThe two biggest culprits of wage theft. Yeah, lets have them handle it.'
b'Thats not the point I am making. We WANT people to stay home, but it will have a major impact on our business as well.'
b"Oh I'm fully aware, just thought I'd point out the lip service the tweet was giving *us*, the companies dont care."
b'More like 2%... but still...'
b'/s'
b'Nah that\xe2\x80\x99s what HR is designed for.'
b'This is an actual solution. \n\n\nFuck anyone that is encouraging any child, teacher or staff to come to school in a Corona virus ridden area.'
b'Exactly. \n\nKids, touch everything.'
b"Like paid sick leave provided by the government so your employer doesn't have to."
b'Washington State recently passed a law (I think two years ago) where everyone pays \xe2\x80\x9cillness premiums,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really a new form of tax (it\xe2\x80\x99s important they call it something else because Washington State does not have any income tax).\n\nThe idea is we all pay into a fund, and then when people need to take sick leave they can, and the government pays for their sick time, up to some number of week.\n\nBut this is for sick *leaves* not sick *days*. Leaves are extended periods of time, more than three days, like the two weeks you\xe2\x80\x99d need with COVID-19.\n\nThey also have a new requirement that employees be allowed to accrue sick time that companies will pay for, to deal with sick days.\n\nBoth programs also enable you to take care of someone that is sick in your family.\n\nThese kinds of programs are the kinds we need. Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for this thread, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details because my employer offers unlimited paid sick time (lucky me) so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to investigate the law as much. I know they take a portion of my earnings to pay the fund, and I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that because I\xe2\x80\x99d rather pay for others to receive benefits in ways that make sense.\n\nUnfortunately now the program is flooded with applicants and is falling behind. This was true even before COVID-19, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better unless it\xe2\x80\x99s getting more resources.'
b">y lots of people while they are shut down, when their customers are cancelling orders or avoiding new purchases.  When they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cash to pay the mortgage, utilities, invoices for inventory,  they also can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the wages.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of what they want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they can do.  We should be prepared to see emergency financing facilities like in previous crises and it will be a shit show of people screaming about bailouts and who gets them.\n\n we tax all of them uniformly and progressively so it's equitable (not equal) across the board and prevents one business from cutting it to gain an advantage over their competition."
b'Here we go, the endless cycle of one upping each others sick days and PTO'
b'Always get the policies fully explained in writing before you consider the offer.'
b'21 days including holidays and sick days is awful.  The US has about 10 holidays they celebrate so you are actually only getting about 2 weeks of combined sick time and vacation time that isn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to a holiday.'
b'We get 10 PTOs, 10 calendar holidays and 3 sick leave. If we work a Saturday or a Calendar holiday due to a production release we get an extra PTO.\n\nI used to work in Europe. We had 15 Calendar holidays, 32 PTOs, unlimited sick time with doctors note. if I worked any of the Calendar holidays I got additional PTO. I was able to take a Month of vacation back home every year as well as many short 2-3 day breaks when work wasnt super busy to go visit neigboring countries.'
b'The problem is abuse.\n\nMost places implement a use it or lose it. Hardly ever does a company pay you out for any time you did not take at the end of the Fiscal year'
b"....but what about the CEO's million dollar bonuses that they so desperately need?!!!!!   (Sarcasm)"
b'Yes. Yes we do.'
b"They do (have to pay extra for it), but it would only paid about 1/2 of my salary and wouldn't pay me until I was out for a month.  As the primary caregiver with 4 kids I couldn't afford to do that."
b'Same in Poland, 26 days PTO per annum and unlimited paid sick leave at 80% base salary.'
b'That is basically the case in almost all - at least rich - countries in the whole world.'
b'Uh I work in the US for one of the companies that regularly makes the "worst employer" lists and we have the same policy.  If I get sick on vacation, I get to use a sick day instead of vacation day.'
b">The US is just totally fucked up.\n\nDepends on how wealthy you are.\n\nI work a very good job and if I get sick on a holiday all I have to do is tell my boss and he'll change it to a sick day."
b'US. One time I had scheduled a vacation, got food poisoning while there and was basically sitting in the bathroom for 2.5 days out of 4 when I got back. My boss said "that sucks, but at least you\'re back here!" I didn\'t have a vacation and they thought it was great that I was back at my desk. Such a stupid mentality.'
b'My state made sick and holiday pay separate so my pos work eliminated holiday pay.'
b"That's fucked up. We need to get away from work when were not sick too"
b"if they're in america, it's huge"
b"I work in food service, and it's my job to handle this crisis. I'm honestly at a loss for what to do - if somebody reports being sick, I will probably give them PTO. But if I announce a Coronavirus 'PTO bank', you better bet everybody is going to use it almost immediately, sick or not."
b'Yeah I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure all major shipping companies are not giving free paid time off and all those drivers come into contact with a ton of people.'
b'I work in a local butcher shop for a large loblaws chain and theyll hire people part time, give them full time hours then they dont get sick days or PTO. Just a lump sum vacation pay in summer. Only the full timers get PTO and sick days. Gotta squeeze every dollar into profits!'
b'Almost twenty years ago I used to work in retail and the store managers would give us some serious grief if we tried to call in sick. Sometimes they would ask for a doctors note...\n\nI was so irritated and wanted to say \xe2\x80\x9clook I\xe2\x80\x99m a part time worker who works 40+ hours a week. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the crappy health plan and I don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick leave so if I call in sick I don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid which hurts me financially\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nI am not going to spend money I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the doctors office if I feel like crap for a day or two and just self quarantine myself in my bedroom.\n\nOthers would drag their sick butts into work hacking on their hands, putting their hands on product as they pack your bags.'
b"I am a restaurant general manager. Last week I thought I might be coming down with strep, and was facing absolutely no option to stay away from my store. A few weeks ago, I was suffering some sort of weird stomach bug that was more pain than action, but I still had to show up and do my job 6 days that week.\n\nModern life relies heavily on fast food, and yet we overlook serious protections necessary to ensure that food service is provided safely. People want their food as cheap as possible, so I don't even really blame my FOO (boss) for being unable to pay me sick leave (we are seeing increases in sales volume yet have to cut labor hours to afford operations costs, because franchise restaurants are very low profit outfits (with rising food costs, mandatory low price menu deals, skyrocketing rent and insurance rates, etc.)."
b"You'll be making it up by working extra when everyone else is sick.\n\nIf you're exempt and don't get overtime, see if your company can retroactively return PTO or add more to your bank if you work excessive hours later."
b'FMLA pay'

b"Not uniquely terrible. They're on a par with most third world countries. Except that Senegal, one of the poorest countries in the world, had free health care for under fives. So in some cases worse than some third world countries."

b'Absolutely! And so many other disgustingly sociopathic things about this country. I pray for not another life lost due to this, but if anything good comes from it will be a changing of the way things are currently are so I think we better for the average person in the same way the depression did.'
b"For real, same.. I can't afford to be out of work for a few weeks. I'm trying to save what I can just in case."
b'I work primarily for a large Silicon Valley employer but I am actually a contractor and our company also has other clients.\n\nWell my client just asked us to work from home . So as I am a manager my company thinks with no employees in office, I have nothing to do so can I go do a 2 week assessment at another client. \n\nI am sure the other client will appreciate when I tell them I am breaking self quarantine to come cough on them.'
b'Wish all of my coworkers thought that way.'
b'Even though my coworkers and I could 100% do our jobs from home, our company would still have us trek through public transit in an area with confirmed cases and have butts in seats. Apparently, as long as we wash our hands- all good.'

b"Can he get a second job right now?  Grocery night stock, gas station attendant, anything likely to stay open?  If he's in a low risk group, if things get bad in your area I'm sure hospitals, clinics, and health departments will be hiring people for their entry level jobs while experienced folks get moved up the ladder due to widespread need of more services.\n\nGot a mortgage?  Call them the instant your state/city declares an emergency.  Tell them he's now unemployed indefinitely due to health crisis and you need to make arrangements for your mortgage.\n\nIf you're not paying that, it will buy a lot of groceries/utilities.\n\nIf you're renting, talk to the LL as soon as you have trouble making rent - before that payment is due.  Worst case, they might let you break the lease instead of ending up with an eviction on your record.\nStart calling family/friends/coworkers for couchsurfing options.\n\nGo ahead and cancel any discretionary spending now."

b'Sounds fantastic'
b"That's literally the fucking point of why we need it"
b"Liberal welfare states are a bit different from social democracy (which is what most people mean by democratic socialism). The main difference is that social democracy doesn't bother with means testing every program, it makes them universal to reduce complexity and maximize access.\n\nFor example, currently student financial aid is gatekept by family income. However, if you get denied a grant due to your parents high income, they have no obligation to pay for your tuition and you may be stuck with high interest loans despite having a need for the aid if they refuse to help.\n\nHealthcare is also greatly simplified by giving universal access. This is done across the developed world and even in some less developed parts.\n\nFor an example in the US, just look at K-12 education. No one thinks we should means test parents and charge a sliding scale of tuition for your kid to go to school. Education is considered a basic, universal right and is taxpayer funded in its entirety for simplicity and maximum equity."
b'The idea is that America is so entrenched in capitalism that without flat out destroying every federal branch, every upper level executive in every american company, including banks, capitalism won\'t be deconstructed. And even then you have a lot of the working class kind of brainwashed into defending the shit anyways.\n\nSo "democratic socialism" or whatever it\'s called is the next best thing.\n\nBut hey, maybe covid19 will do exactly that.'
b"Social safety net??? THAT'S COMMUNISM!\n/s"
b"No that's social democracy. Not the same thing"
b'Yeah and it works just fine in a lot of places.'
b"No that's Nordic model capitalism."
b"Yeah. Honestly I think anything we do is just a platitude that will make people feel better about things. Unless we are willing to literally shut down everything for a month I don't think we can stop transmission. Slow? Sure. Stop? Not a chance.\n\nMy kids daycare just sent out a notice that any child found with a fever will be asked to stay home for 48 hours instead of only 24. Like that's gonna do anything."
b"In Australia they brought in medical certificates at the pharmacy. You go in with symptoms and they assess you. eg a bad cold you don't function well so why turn up and infect others.  \nDoctor is free because of nationalised medicine.\n\nPharmacy medical certificate costs money so if not really sick then lose money for sickpay."
b"What he or she said about Germany isn't entirely true. It's when you miss 3 consecutive days of work or more that you definitely need a doctor's note."
b"In the UK, I can self-certify as sick for 7 days. If I want paid sick leave after that, I need a doctor's note."
b'It isn\'t required until day 3 off of work. \n\nThis mind set is the thing I do not miss from the US. There are a ton of GPs around me. It takes less than 5 minutes for me to get to a doctors office on foot. The next closest is in the center of my town, a 5 minute tram ride away. \n\nIt also isn\'t "[a] waste of time" or "infantaliz[ing] the adult population." It allows doctors here to prevent potentially serious illnesses that could crop up from not treating something.\n\nIn the US on the other hand, you don\'t have the "luxury" of just walking to your local GP, having them immediately accept your insurance and you actually get to talk to someone. In the states when I was still living there, you had to find a GP that was in-network, you\'d have to make an appointment, then figure out how to get to that appointment because it sure as fuck wasn\'t within walking distance, then wait for 2+ hours to talk to a doctor, and then you get to pay for the pleasure. \n\nI get it, the mindset is different, but just because the system in the US doesn\'t work, doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t in other countries.'
b"Let me be clear that I don't think any country in the world has a perfect system! My comment was only meant to point out that there are ways that employers wouldn't have to worry about abuse of the system. With an issue like chronic migraines, that is perhaps something which must be worked out with employers on a case by case basis."
b'Employment lawyer here (but not yours and this is not legal advice).\n\nJust last week, someone was asking me what they could do when a woman called out sick for a couple of days when her request for PTO was denied. Unfortunately, the local paid sick leave law said that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t require a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note because it was only two days. The woman had a history of doing stuff like this, too \xe2\x80\x94 in multiple years she\xe2\x80\x99d use literally all of her sick time for the year on Mondays and Fridays, and she\xe2\x80\x99d come in with contagious illnesses other times. So even if asking for a note for a 1-2 day absence is usually overkill, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prohibited. There has to be a way to prevent abuse. Requiring documentation from a medical professional is much better than letting managers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t medical professionals make judgment calls, and you invite discrimination lawsuits when you don\xe2\x80\x99t apply requirements like that across the board; requiring a note every time makes sense. And as telemedicine becomes more common, the downsides of requiring a note will get smaller.\n\nIn any case, an employee with a migraine (or another disability with intermittent flare-ups) could ask to be reasonably accommodated by being exempted from a general requirement to provide a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note to use sick leave.'

b'Reddit:  where you get downvoted for asking a question. \n\nHow does this work?  Who\xe2\x80\x99s eligible for sick leave, for how long, and where does the money to pay for it come from?'
b'This is really going to test the actuarial work that was done to establish the sick leave fund.  Which sounds like it was maybe failing already.  \n\nCompanies who self insure their health care insurance plans especially have incentives to offer generous sick leave because a sick employee at work generates more claims (in addition to lost productivity) when they infect others.\n\nI do wonder if the state laid off some of the big event risk (pandemic) to third parties, like reinsurance or something.'
b"Here I'll keep the chain going: unlimited paid sick time here, 3 weeks of PTO, paid federal holidays. Thankfully not all employers are evil..."
b"Yup. I learned that mistake the hard way, which sucks because one of the reasons why I took this job was because I thought it would be more PTO days which would have allowed my wife and I to travel a little bit. Won't make that mistake again."
b"They know enough people will not confront them, and just assume they're not being hazy, that they basically don't worry about it.\n\nThe one person who acts up and calls up a manager and asks them to clarify the policy and doesn't take the job is worth the fifty people who  are just ecstatic to have a job and don't realize it until they get sick for the first time and can't come to work."
b"Yeah. I've been lucky to have a manager who sometimes allows work from home when we aren't feeling well but it's completely dependent on her mood and whether or not she likes you that week. I've used it a few times to work remote but other times I just end up coming to work and disinfecting everything I touch and staying away from people because I don't have the days to spare."

b'Yeah I get 15 days(after a year of service) + 9 holidays. I have to be on call with check in meetings on Black Friday, thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve, so they really aren\xe2\x80\x99t holidays. They are enacting a 7 holiday and 2 flex days for people like me, but the 2 flex days only work for other \xe2\x80\x9cfederally recognized holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d So basically I don\xe2\x80\x99t get as many holidays as everyone else since These reset in February and I can\xe2\x80\x99t take them until I\xe2\x80\x99m officially in the on call rotation for holiday which I will be as I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one on my team with this perk... \nIt takes another 5 years of service to get to 20 days pto. \nYou better believe I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to work from home the days that I\xe2\x80\x99m sick. I may not be as productive but I\xe2\x80\x99m not wasting my pto on this.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the major problem: dishonest workers using sick time frivolously. My job has PTO and a very generous occurrence policy. However, these were put into place by the Union. The company still treats us poorly, which means most employees have a lack of respect for the company. If the company treated us better, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99d have fewer unnecessary call outs'

They may need to misdirect attention from that considering Trump has for sure been tested frequently and they would know immediately as soon as it were detectable.'
b"He doesn't meet the CDC guidelines and does not want to publicly undermine them. At least he is self-quarantining. That's good. Look what happened to Iran's government once it started spreading to government officials ."
b'not enough tests available.'
b'False, testing is always useful.'
b"Conspiracy time, he's scared to catch it, staying home."
b"Much like masks. We dont have enough testing capacity. It's best to save them for when they will work the best"
b"It's probably true that it's not very helpful. Even when people have symptoms severe enough to go to the hospital PCR is only positive 70 percent of the time. Once the diseases progresses they are able to catch nucleotides and it turns positive."
b'not like we don\xe2\x80\x99t already have multiple countries showed lack of testing will make the disease spread like wildfire. in addition, lack of social safety net and affordable healthcare, you will have symptomatic people still going to work because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to.'
b"There isn't *enough* tests available is what is happening with the US, most likely. And it's not just a deficiency in resources (testing reagents, kits, equipment, etc.), it's likely also a lack of time and trained technicians available."

The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so.

b"I mean does it matter whether they want it or not? It's not like the virus is gonna listen to us."
b"Some people do. I'm not one. Many hate the current state of affairs, in this nation and other nations and the world, because of what they've suffered. And they want positive change, and genuine, long-term improvement in their lives but have watched the opposite occur. Constantly stymied and disappointed, their disappointment turns into frustration, then resentment, then hatred and rage. This drove people to fall for Obama's hope and change bullshit (me, for example) and for Trump's drain-the-swamp bullshit (my family, for example). We want a better society but every election, every mass movement, every revolution recedes leaving the same garbage in its wake. I suspect some of us hope to see this pandemic force society to change for the better, and if it doesn't then bring it all crashing down so the survivors can build something better. I don't believe this, but I certainly feel a lot of impotent rage and choking despair these days and have for years."

b'I think some people are getting off on this. Legitimate concern is secondary to having some excitement in their lives.'
b"It doesn't seem to me that people want a catastrophe. I get the impression that many Americans are afraid, confused, and just want a strong response. If it's not bad enough for serious action to be taken, isn't it better to get worse fast instead of letting it fester until it's too late?"
b"There are people in the House, the Senate, and the White House who've been in close contact with positives. Pence has \\*two\\* already.

However, globally they are continually testing people even if they don't have symptoms."
b"It's either that or simply - why bother testing when they already know the results? I'm guessing at this point, if they rolled out massive testing nationwide this week... we'd quickly discover covid is already here by the 100s, if not 1000s of infected people. \n\nNo point confirming if they already know and it seems to be priority #1 to not cause any panic, because panic will be disastrous to the US economy"

b'No. A year is for the vaccines. The anti-viral from Gilead is already shown to be safe as it was tested for Ebola in mass trials. Its also shown effective in China on Coronavirus.

I hate Trump, but right now I am rooting for him to be the strong leader that this country needs. He is, at least for the next 10 months, our president and it is his duty to guide us through this and protect American lives. I hope all Americans wish him luck and hope for his success in that. \n\nI am sorry that you think liberals wish ill upon Trump, especially in this time."
b"They are only saying that it's not travel-related and haven't revealed anything else. I bet she has had contact with a confirmed case, whether within TN or not."

b'You are not spelling that antiviral correctly. It is also already available and used in treatments. People still die'
b'The reality of the situation is that regardless of what happens - Say a vaccine is found. Easy and cost-effective treatments developed - The core ideas of how not to get it are just generally good ideas. \n\nKeep a stocked pantry of dry goods. Wash your fucking hands. Try not to touch your face. \n\nThese are solid principles for just about any kind of communicable disease or large scale disaster.'
b"People don't get the basic mathematics of it. Because there's no vaccine. It's going to continue to spread exponentially. Probably.

b'Yeah. Pretty much this coulda been a tragic and rough thing to deal with but had we taken it serious and taken necessary actions we would be in better shape long term \n\nInstead we have the idiot masses thinking shits all lovely and continue on as if this really is the flu and in turn creating a bigger shit storm.'
b"Ironically, they were only able to do that because he was trying to work with them for the sake of the country's long-term political health.\n\nHis biggest mistake was expecting the GOP to govern in good faith, and as far as I'm concerned, that will forever taint *their* legacy, not his."

b'I believe 16 have died there now.'
b'The US did pledge an emergency 8.1 billion to this outbreak, with 3 billion towards a vaccine. Most vaccines cost about 200 million or so to develop so hopefully we can find a cure quickly.    \n     \nAlso, no one knew how serious it would be, if you look at SARS and MERS, if we created a US pandemic response it would be a lot of wasted money; we see it\xe2\x80\x99s over here now. We need to stop harping on woulda, coulda, shoulda, and move forward to clamp it down.   \n    \nWe need more state involvement though.

Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t WA state shut down businesses, public gathers, and imposed their own quarantine?

b"Just saw a video about random sampling tests in my country, wouldn't be useful if mild or asymptomatics never tested positive."
b'Not that I disagree, and he should be tested anyway, but to be fair, the definition of "mild" includes people who have fevers, coughs, etc that the public would generally call "sick". It basically just means they don\'t need intensive care. So that inflates those numbers a whole lot...'

Your argument is completely irrelevant to what I said."

The CDC staff was forced to drag these other people and they had the wrong gear so probably wound up spreadhing the viris and bringing it here.

I blame trump because he, as commander in chief, could have done something faster and sooner. The buck stops with him. He should have done an executive order to use the WHO kits while waiting for FDA/CDC to do their thing.'
b"> did the Trump admin explicitly intervene?\n\nProbably. Will we ever hear about it? Unlikely, at least not until there's a Democrat in the White House."
b"Probably the most fucked up part is how he and his cronies are trying to make this political when they are clearly missing a great opportunity to score HUGE political points with the American people.\n\nThe trouble is that Trump is incapable of achieving greatness. He was handed millions of dollars from his dad and a small real estate empire and has done nothing but lose all the long day. He is a loser and will never be able to achieve anything more than failure. Of course, everyone that knew him beyond Apprentice knew this but the vast majority of his supporters only know the TV personality.\n\nMany people have pointed out that the flu is worse, and diabetes is worse and heart disease is worse but none of those things is this administration's fault due to inaction... But this virus definitely is entirely on the Trump administration because they are all too stupid to just get the fuck out of the way and let the professionals handle it.\n\nJust the fact that he goes on TV daily to talk about how great he is or how smart he is - proves he is neither of these things."
b"But for about 20% of infected people in my country they have no clue where they got it, so I think it's already too late for that here, I don't think it can be stopped effectively with that method."
b'Some very smart people, I only know the best people,  are saying it constantly. They also mentioned something about JFK?'

b"Probably just some different old ones, tbh. It can't kill them all!"
b'Please avoid off-topic political discussions.\n\nOur policy on political posts is as follows:\n\nThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned.'
b'Should have been 3.'
b"Trump and Pence fall, guess who gets to be the prez?\n\nNancy Pelosi.\n\n\nThey're all old af so really like 75% of our elected federal officials could be peacing out soon"

b">At some point you have to wonder how this country can successfully compete with healthier more educated nations.\n\nBecause it's great if you are rich. We literally have the best medical technology and best medical personnel in the world bar none, no one even comes close.\n\nBut you only get access to it if you are rich."
b"Life expectancy has almost nothing to do with healthcare.\n\nAmericans die earlier than people from other developed nations because they're fatter, more sedentary, more violent, more likely to die in a car crash, etc. And the decrease in life expectancy was fentanyl."
b"We just import those higher educated with higher salaries.  Those that stayed here clearly didn't pull themselves up by their bootstraps enough.  \n\nI'd love to put '/s' in, but it's really just reality."
b"1. Consolidation and vertical integration of pharmaceutical suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors is probably the number one cause of cost increases. Pharma manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies  all are out there to profit, and a incredibly complex web of entities makes sure that no one has any price transparency. Very few players means little competition, and the complexity means huge barriers to entry keep anyone else out. \n2. We tend to overuse and over charge for diagnostic tests that may not be needed in some cases. This is partly to reduce risk of lawsuits as we are very litigious against doctors. But also hospitals encourage high usage of these tests to help make up for the losses they are required legally to take on by caring for the uninsured. Hospitals sometimes take losses on doctors salaries because they know if they employ them, they can force them to use their diagnostic facilities. \n3. Palliative care is viewed as a defeat. We don't encourage patients to define before hand the extent of intervention they desire, so we do everything we can to keep them alive, even beyond what would be comfortable or perhaps desirable for the patient. \n4. The model health care is paid for is generally by the amount of service provided. We are just staring to incorporate health care outcomes into how these services are paid for (this was thanks to Obama and the ACA). Without incorporating quality of outcomes and utilization into the payment model, lots of unnecessary care was encouraged by the model itself. \n5. Massive administrative overhead due to a  system with multiple insurance companies\n6. Lack of good technological standards to help share information effectively. The ACA somewhat helped with this, but the software and standards out there are still incredibly primitive. \n\nThere are no doubt other major factors but these are a few I know well enough to explain."
b'Probably bc we don\xe2\x80\x99t do preventative healthcare. It saves a lot more money if you catch stuff at early stages rather than going to the ER when things get super serious. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'CDC has and was always one of the top groups to fight this sort of shit.. This is 100% caused by Trump putting a lacky "yes man" as head of CDC and then telling him to keep the numbers down...'
b'why else'
b'I think with the list of people responsible there are people much further ahead of them as far as responsibility. Starting with CDC and not having enough tests and not provising any adidtional resources for patient care for weeks. then whoever decided not to use WHO Tests. the blood is on their hands.'
b'I like that analogy'
b"Reminds me of the part in animal farm when the horse finally realizes that he's going off to the glue farm and starts to furiously kick at the door of his moving stall to get out"
b"Yes and no. You can't stop it, but earlier, faster treatment and a better handle on statistics for macro management are huge."
b'*Salutes you in passing*'
b'You know that Nancy is 6 years older than Trump? And Pence is a decently young 60 year old. I think she needs to be the most worried out of the 3.'
b'Hahaha \xf0\x9f\x98\x84'
b"Some might say that's a blessing in disguise..."
b'Um... from the article:\n\n>(Question): What were mild, severe and critical? We think of \xe2\x80\x9cmild\xe2\x80\x9d as like a minor cold.\n\n>> (Answer): No. **\xe2\x80\x9cMild\xe2\x80\x9d was a positive test, fever, cough \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen.** \xe2\x80\x9cSevere\xe2\x80\x9d was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. \xe2\x80\x9cCritical\xe2\x80\x9d was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.'
b'Really I define it as\n\nMild 80% - Can be treated at home\n\nSevere 16% - Needs to be hospitalized\n\nCritical 4% - Needs an ICU bed with ventilators\n\nThe 80% cases while it may be shit for the people going through are not going to  a)kill them b) overwhelm the medical infrastructure and kill other people like say those with heart attacks who cant get an ICU bed as all ventilators are being used for COVID patients.\n\nSo the 80% does not worry me. Its the 20% needing hospital beds is what worries me. \n\nFor comparison the Flu numbers are 90% not needing hospitalization,2% needing ventilators and .1% dying.\n\nIts a very very very bad flu season and the hospital infrastructure in the US can barely handle a very bad flu season.\n\nFurther these percentages are not even across age groups. For those over 80, its 60% needing hopitalization, 50% on ventilators and 15% dying.\n\nUSA does not have a culture of triage where you decide that the veiitlator and ICU bed needs to be kept available for in case you get a 30 yr old car accident victim by letting the 80 yr old Covid patient die so all ICU beds will get used up for the 80 yr olds.'
b"Don't you think that the fact that heads of agencies like the CDC being appointed based on political merit is a bigger issue?"
b'Haha, I think you are right'
b'I think if you get pneumonia you won\xe2\x80\x99t be thinking it is mild.'
b"Trump, against all norms, politicized a bunch of previously non-political roles in the administration. This is a fault of our modern politics that we elect someone would do that and don't hold them accountable. \n\nNo system is immune to corruption under those circumstances."
b'Since when? Trump may have done this but the previous administration, like many before it, hired exceptionally qualified people when and where possible. Not political hacks.'

b'Germany is a bit weird.  You need a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note to miss work, even if you work in a white collar job where your employer presumably trusts you not to lie.  This is a nice first step, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also incredibly backwards compared to most of the US.'

b'Actually, for the 20 years i work now in germany, calling in sick was never an issue and always supported by the employer ( from small company to 50.00ppl enterprise):  \n\n\n"Go home, get better and ffs don\'t infect the rest ."'
b'The entire German economy just called in sick.'
b"That service is quite controversial though. It's a bit of a gray area, even though our health minister openly supports it.

Though if the doctor requires you to pay them a visit in order to allow sick leave, you might catch a corona infection, so maybe you still want to risk using the online service\xe2\x80\xa6"

b"Your employers never has to trust the AU that you hand in and can demand that you get checked by a doctor of the company's choice. But if you are at that point you might have other problems at hand."
b'THIS!'
b'Sure.\n\nAnd what they currently do is pure marketing. 0\xe2\x82\xac for the Covid sick note.\n\nUsually 18\xe2\x82\xac(!) for the note as pdf or 26\xe2\x82\xac (!!!) for the note via mail. If you go to the doctor it costs you 0\xe2\x82\xac.'
b'Marketing.\n\nA doctor is also "free" while this site usually charges you 18\xe2\x82\xac for one of these sick notes.'
b"You are right, it's written on the Home page. They probably didn't update the FAQ yet."
b'It\'s unnecessary and a bit condescending towards Americans. I mean, what else would it be other than a paid sick leave? Does something like an "unpaid sick leave" even exist in Germany?'
b'Are you german?'
b"I would like to know if this is actually legit and legal, as my workplace just sent out an internal email to all of us saying that they won't accept these types of ''beschinigung'' as it does not have the necessary evidentiary value.\n\nIs it legal for them to reject it?\n\nEdit: Berlin, Germany"
b'Yes sorry. I confused the offer in the link (talk to a doctor online and get an old fashioned sick note as pdf ) with Germany\xe2\x80\x99s plans to make sick notes    machine readable electronic documents.\nHowever the legitimacy of the offer linked in the post is still under dispute:\nhttps://www.mopo.de/ratgeber/gesundheit/ohne-arztbesuch-krankschreibung-im-internet---bleibt-das-weiterhin-erlaubt--33506444\nIt basically leans on the fact that a new law now allows virtual doctor visits, which in this case can happen through an app. But you still need to be seen by a doctor. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just \xe2\x80\x9eclick on your symptoms and print your sick note\xe2\x80\x9c...'
b'Ja :)'
b"I don't think so. Talk to your insurance, most of them have a remote way of seeing a doctor these days."
b"I'm sure it varies, but I have an individual Blue Shield plan and 24/7/365  video/phone consultations are offered at no additional charge through a program called Teledoc. They can diagnose, treat, and write prescriptions. Check with your insurance provider. :)"
b'Sorry Carsten, but this is simply not true. I took sick leave about a strong cold more than once and always clearly stated that I could not justify to infect customers or colleagues. My doc always agreed. It is surely different if you work alone without guest-or customer contact.'
b"That's up to the doctor. You won't get fired when your doctor says you are too sick to work. It's not up to your company to decide that.\n\nAnd if right now doctors are not a bit more freely with giving sick leave for people showing symptoms, than they are idiots. But that's still up to your doctor, not the company."
b'That would be every German employment lawyer\'s wet dream. Hell... it\'s even near to impossible to fire those people sitting on their asses doing nothing. Like really nothing. You have to find something to write an "Abmahnung", they will fight that in court, then another Abmahnung, next court session. Rinse and repeat. And people are wondering why companies are paying double or even tripple of the salary cost to hire loaned employees from Hay\'s and alikes. \n\nI think even hinting you might be fired when calling in sick is a huge no-no. \n\nBut people in Germany go to work sick despite being paid to stay home sick. Because stupid/narcissistic . All those fawning about employees working despite being sick is a really stupid element of German working culture. This needs to stop and people have to be called out and shamed for this selfish narcissistic shit.'
b'And even if, you get money form the state if you lose your job. Germany helps it citizens and thereby itself by not letting them become completely vulnerable, so they have a better chance at get back into the workforce. Sure it helps that it\xe2\x80\x99s a country that well off, but the rest is just a question of outlook.'
b'This contradicts the typical storyline of "Hurr durr sick leave by law in Europe/Germany, people stay home when they\'re sick and can\'t get fired, America no sick leave, America bad"'
b"That is true, but on the otherhand going to your GP takes time, and many do not give appointments, instead they have consultation hours.\n\nSo you have to drive / walk to your GP, sit in the waiting room (maybe for a hour or two), drive / walk back home. This is all the time you haven't been able to use to recover.\n\nEdit: And you won't infect others or get infected."
b"I see no problem. Use it now if you need it and then don't use it anymore."
b'Sure, but which is better in case you have mild symptoms and have been in a risk region, or had contact to confirmed cases:\n\n- go to your GP and risk infecting him and other patients\n\n- get a free online exam and stay at home till it passes'
b'Wait you were serious? I thought you were joking. There is 100% paid sick leave for up to 6 weeks, after that you get "sick money" (bad translation) from social insurance which is about 70% of your income.'
b"You think this sub revolves around America? No, it doesn't. Coronavirus is affecting the entire world. Sort yourself out. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
b'Austrian living in Germany'
b'Yes it is. Your workplace cannot not accept it. If you use their service and your employer troubles you, au-schein.de CEO is lawyer and will help you with it.'
b'>Is it legal for them to reject it?\n\nIt is highly debated between lawyers and not as clear as [**Takia\\_Gecko**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Takia_Gecko/) tries to make it.\n\nThere is a  court decision that denied an employee sick leave because his doc didn\'t personally see him.\n\nThe argument goes like:\n\n\\- You have to prove to your emplayer that you are actually sick.\n\n\\- usually, a "Arbeitsunf\xc3\xa4higkeitsbescheinigung" (sick notice) from a MD is prove enough.\n\n\\- But if the MD didn\'t actually see you, that lessens the evidentiary value considerably.\n\n\\- if there are reasons to believe you are not sick, it might not be enough in the end.\n\n\\- In the end, courts will always have to decide those cases. But if you do not want to be the one going to court, i would advice to go a real MD...its free and definitly prove enough.'
b'Fun fact: It\'s the same legal loophole websites, that sell you prescription medication without you actually having a prescription, are using. Some "friend" of mine has some experience with this. Basically you click on your symptoms, some arabic doctor in Romania who has somehow a german medical license makes a prescription out of it and sends this prescription to a german pharmacy which sends the medication to you.\n\n> But you still need to be seen by a doctor. \n\nThat\'s exactly the loophole afaik, since the law talks only about "consultation with a doctor" and doesn\'t describe the necessity to be actually at the doctor\'s place.'
b'You can also call in sick upto three days without going getting a dorctors note.\n\nedit: Usually, the emplayer can insist on doctors notice from the first day, wich isnt done often, usually when someone calls in sick often  or at suspicious times.'
b"I don't know about Germany but in my country if your employer fires you for taking sick leave you can pretty easily take them to court and win. Firing anyone outside of limited probation period must involve certain minimum process (verbal warning, formal warning, review etc)"
b"Yes, because it is not true. If your doctor grants you sick leave, you get sick leave. \nResponsible Companies might even allow one or more days of sick leave without a doctor's notice."
b'in germany you are Not getting fired because of Boeing sick...... small businesses may try but large companies cant do it under normal circumstances'
b'Just phone your doc, no need to use a controversial online service.'

b'Thank you!'
b'From how I understand it the \xe2\x80\x9eau-Schein\xe2\x80\x9c app used to put people into contact with doctors using WhatsApp but due to data protection concerns a chat has now been integrated into the app. The new law allows for virtual encounters and they are covered by insurances. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they can offer the service for free: They collect your insurance information and get reimbursed by your insurance.  However there is still some debate about whether you should be able to consult with a doctor you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before in such manner. Or if this should only be allowed with doctors that treat you on a regular basis, like your GP...'
b'Not everywhere. The company I work for requires it from day 1, which is especially nice if you need to stay home for a day or two due to your fucked up mental health :)'
b"Yeah, good luck getting someone on the phone there. It's next to impossible even during a normal flu season, at least in the morning."
b'And your doc will bring you the sick note to your home, right?\n\n\nLmao'
b"The Paid Family and Medical Leave act in MA doesn't give out benefits until 01/01/2021.  Other than that, I do believe sick leave is employer dependent."
b"Dude it's not my fault that your government doesn't care about it's working class"
b"No one's gonna get banned because your fragile american ego was hurt, lol. Just wait until you learn we can get paid sick leave for up to 3 years here in France."
b"I'm convinced that you're an ignoramus and a troll as well. See ya!"
b'True, the law says, the employer can insist on doctors noteice from day one, buw normally and if someone osnt sick too often, upto three days is tolerated.'
b'Send via mail? Or is this exclusive to this usually paid website?'
b'Alda, wat?'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been an activist and voting for healthcare for all for all of my adult life. The propaganda here is strong and people are individualistic and selfish. Every time I watch a YouTube video I get an ad that talks about (lies) that if Colorado was to get state healthcare that we would get less care and have to wait longer and so many doctors and nurses would lose their jobs. It\xe2\x80\x99s insane.'
b"For what? You're not even working in France. All you do is protesting and surrendering."
b"That's how it was for me when I worked in retail. Now I have an office job that is somehow worse, mainly because my boss is an ass."
b'This would be equally as difficult as asking US GP\xe2\x80\x98s to start to test people. This would mean extra work for the doctors offices. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.'
b'Troll much?'

b'Translation: \n\nThe girl from 3rd grade (in Netherlands this is 1st grade)  is struggling with what Martien Nijenhuis (director of school) calls "a cold. The symptoms are mild. " The child got the symptoms during the weekend, which means the chance that she has infected others at school is small, according to Nijenhuis. The contact investigation of the GGD is still ongoing.   (GGD is our CDC and this means they don\'t know where she got it).'
b'.... And Albania is closing schools after 2 confirmed cases in their country. I am so furious at how my country is "handling" this situation.'

b"Well, the general treatment procedure in NL is if you aren't dead, it's not treatment worthy. The universal drug paracetamol helps against everything. I even got recommended once to eat licorice for bronchitis."

b"Germany here. Just heard that a few people from my company are at home as a precaution.\n\nApparently, a teacher from one of the guy's kids was tested positive, and they only tested the first row of the kids..."
b'I\'m just curious as to how the administration can be like "Yup, this is the best course of action"'
b"Sort it out!! I love the Netherlands and always thought the Dutch would do a better job. A health conscious country that is proud and has good healthcare? Cmon, you guys should have handled this better. I'm sorry your government is failing you. \n\nMeant to be coming to Rotterdam in May but I'll be skipping that. I will return with my tourist money soon as it's under control"

b"Why aren't these government run healthcare countries texting???"
b"ZERO WORLDWIDE fatalities under age 11.\n\nZERO.\n\nBut, let's keep panicking."
b'This is honestly the strangest thing in this country (NL). I am now sick as a bat at home. Half my office is sick at home. We had one colleague that came back from Italy 2 weekends ago, and got sick this past weekend and has been advised by her doctor to stay home. But they won\xe2\x80\x99t test her.\nMy colleagues and I all have corona symptoms but we won\xe2\x80\x99t get tested since we have not been in contact with someone who tested positive. But the person that testes positive, they won\xe2\x80\x99t test her. Like....?????? Shady business.'

b'Belgium has entered the chat; "Hold my corona."\n\nWe\'re not doing any better in Belgium. Schools with confirmed cases are not closed, no extra testing,... Last week I developed all of the symptoms except fever, I called my doctor only to get told not to worry, just a cold. I had a dry cough, sore throat and from time to time mild pain in my right lung... That last one got me worried, but the doc said; "Do not worry! Just a cold." Atm, I\'m feeling 100%, that\'s positive, but now I see some of my family and friends developing exactly the same symptoms...'
b'Press F to pay respects'
b"265 x (1.5)^14 is roughly 80000 reported cases. That's a lot of reported cases. Now think of the amount of people who didn't bother to go to the hospital."

b'Right now Iran is doing a good job at testing as many people as they can.\n\nIt took Iran 20 deaths and infection of a minister, to understand that they can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that nothing is happening. 20 deaths with 82 million population is same as 4 deaths in Netherlands with its 17 million people. Right now there are 3 dead in Netherlands\xe2\x80\xa6'
b'People from every country is whining about the same thing "OMG the Government is doing the wrong things"!!!!!!... But WE have know about the possibility of a pandemia...still the only thing we have done lately is whining about migrants. it\'s out own damn fault.'
b'And it will only get worse since the Netherlands are more densely populated than Iran. Our infrastructure is one of the best as well, which means everyone goes everywhere. God my country needs a smack in the face and man up against COVID-19.'
b'Italy is a fast forward two weeks.'
b'I was really happy when I saw that post, because now I have an illustration for when people say "Just wash your hands." Yeah, about that: I have kids.'
b"People don't realize that just because kids aren't getting seriously sick from the virus, that doesn't mean they won't transmit it to the more at-risk population."
b'>The universal drug paracetamol helps against everything.\n\nSounds like the UK too. "You\'ve probably got a viral infection. Rest and take paracetamol."'
b"I's a damn cold. but it kills weak people..."
b"The first chapter of _Rollback_ by Thomas Woods (it's probably on\nGoogle Books) has stuff about European politicians straight-up\nadmitting state pensions are unsustainable. And so I have to\nwonder if they're delaying -- on what should be the obvious\nresponse -- in order to at least get some boomer culling in first.\n\nI would be tempted, in their shoes. I do believe in the killing vs.\nlet-die distinction."
b'Finally someone with common sense. In the best case scenario the worst is over by summer. \nIn the worst - by years end.  \nIn any case, nothing to be as panicked about as most of the people on this sub. I came here for news about the virus, not to see paranoia.'

b"I work at a school as a Translator, i stay in the classroom and I observe how easily a simple cold can spread, it spreads incredibly easily, it's inctedible."
b'Very much a culture of not causing trouble for others and not sticking out very much.'
b'There is a culture here of not making a big deal out of medical complaints and not over-medicating.\n\nIf you go to a doctor with an cough/cold normally you\'ll be sent home with nothing, and told to get some rest. Got a headache? Drink some water.\n\nThere aren\'t even really "over the counter" cold/flu medications like Lemsip/Beecham\'s available here. If you\'re sick just get some rest and wait it out.\n\nTo be honest it\'s kind of nice.\n\nMaybe not the best attitude when you have an actual epidemic, but we\'ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe healthcare system here is very good and well-provisioned, and the population (inc. elderly) tend to be healthier/more active than in other countries.\n\n(Not Dutch, but live in the Netherlands)'
b'Colds are contagious too...'
b'I was/am sick with the cold like you! I had the exact same symptoms, but instead of cough, I had a runny nose. Experienced pain in my right lung too, especially when I took deep breaths. My sister and boyfriend showing some symptoms since a few days, it scares me.\n\nHave been isolating myself at home since wednesday, don\'t want to infect others or get infected myself. \n\n Same thing being told here by everyone, GP\'s, teachers, nurses, government, society in general : "stop being worried, you just have the flu /cold. Corona is nothing serious". \n\nMy school sent an email yesterday saying student from Noord Brabant (the province with most cases) should stay home when having symptoms, but! They should be aware of possible study delay which means they can\'t make exams and should decide themselves if that is worth staying home... They give students pressure to still attend school while being sick, even when possibly infected with the coronavirus, because I think no student wants to get study delay resulting in not getting enough credits to continue their study.... \n\nI have severe hypochondria and other anxiety related issues and just thinking of going out of the house, using public transport and being in enclosed spaces like classrooms filled with people is nearly enough to give me a panic attack.\n\nI hope for you and your family and friends to stay safe and for our countries to take actual action.'

b'I actually took that to mean \xe2\x80\x9cshe only started coughing and sneezing on the weekend, so there is less of a chance that she infected her schoolmates the week before\xe2\x80\x9d, which is logical but nevertheless not an excuse to discount possible contacts. \n\nAt the very very least, quarantines should be issued to her immediate classmates (i.e. the people she sits with most of the time - do your classrooms work this way? Or do kids rotate beyond a single class?) and teacher.'
b"> If you go to a doctor with an cough/cold normally you'll be sent home with nothing, and told to get some rest. Got a headache? Drink some water.\n\nI mean, it's the same way here(Iceland). If you actually go to the Doctor with the flu he'd just be annoyed you wasted his time like that because he has actually sick people to see. Still there seems to be an understanding here that this is not just the flu."

Nobody is talking like it's the end times.\n\nAs for the potential for violence, yeah I absolutely think *some* Westerners might get violent in a quarantine situation. Europeans and especially Italians don't like being told what to do by the government. A quarantine is a major restrictive order on civil liberties."
b"Luckily we've got everyone that society deems not 'compatible' in prison then eh."

b'Grouping a thief with killers and rapists seems a bit off.\n\nIf one of my family members was in prison for being a thief, I would certainly still love them.'

b'The Simpsons/Trump thing is not nearly as remarkable as some people made it seem. Their episode came out in 2000, and he had announced he was considering running for president in 1999.\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/simpsons-predict-trump/'
b">  and now we have a plague outbreak and the headlines all feel like generated by a game's ai....\n\nYou dont think that plague inc got their inspiration from other outbreaks covered by the media? Do you think this is the first time we're seeing a outbreak?"
b"Wait, you're calling him naive because he said there *are* drugs in jail?\n\nThe irony here is palpable."
b"I mean you're correct in that there are drugs in prisons but no need to be condescending."
b"Are you stating that there's no drugs in prisons? Or maybe was Burt\\_93 the one saying it.\n\nAnyway, there are a lot of drugs inside because most of the people who end up on jail are drug addicts, so the guards are kinda ok with that to avoid more behavioral problems than what they already have."
b'Wait, is it Italy quarantined? How have I missed it? I live inside those areas and except for limitations on social life, I can still go wherever I want. I go to work as past week, I take the train as past week, I go to the grocery store as past week. Nothing changed except few limitations/more public awareness.'
b'Too many Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to just orderly line up and help each other/keep curfew/cooperate/believe what government organizations tell them. During hurricane Katrina aftermath people were shooting at the rescue helicopters.'

b"First one of this magnitude and scope (in 100+ years)... It's also been covered extensively in popular fiction (a lot of you also include zombie outbreaks). \n\nSo, it's all a pretty common 'topic' in fiction/non-fiction, so plenty of 'source material'."
b'Many stupid people on the internet  who have no reading comprehension lol'
b'[deleted]'
b"Oh, you never leave your village? That's fine. Some of us travel places for work or pleasure and find restrictions telling us that we cannot leave a certain area to be highly restrictive (not that it's uncalled for). Nothing changed? Yeah, ok, sure, maybe for you. Different lives, different realities."
b"Lol, wow. And you're the one telling me to chill. And with bolded letters for dramatic flair!"
b'Of course, I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t personally known anyone who is in that situation so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it.  I know plenty of thieves lmao.'
b'> First one of this magnitude and scope (in 100+ years).\n\nSpoiler, its not. Asian Flu and hong kong was **massive**. We also have other problems that still classifies as massive but H1N1 and AIDS. Want me to go on? Or you dont consider these real problems?'
b'Right, he was saying that no drugs is the issue that would really upset the inmates.\n\nAnd then you said he was from another planet.\n\nKeep digging..'
b"Alright, you have a new account and shit. Yeah I'm done discussing with people that have an agenda. Wish you all the best"
b"None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type\n\nAsia/Hong Kong were both severe but fairly localised by comparison, H1N1 had far lower transmission rates, and AIDs is spread in a totally different way so isn't relevant at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is looking to be as big as Spanish Flu in terms of infection, mortality will likely be a far lower rate due to medical advances, but in absolute terms this could kill more."
b'All of those diseases are fucking nothing compared to this lol, how some people still fail to see the path this is going to take baffles me.'
b"How many borders closed for either of those above cases?\n\nHow many kids were out of school compared with the currently 300 million+kids? \n\nWhat was the economic impact compared with this one? All chinese production is currently stopped. Medical ingredients for pharma made in China, shipped to india to make the Meds then to America aren't being manufactured. So a medicine shortage is likely. \n\nLots of shortages are likely. I've never seen ANYTHING like this, in my 40+ years. Have you? H1N1 was hyped and on the news a lot, but it wasn't as communicable...\n\nEdit: Events likely canceled include: SXSW (30 years, first time cancelled), Olympics (when were these cancelled by an outbreak?), etc..."
b'Multiplication factors differ. In terms of combo spreading/mortality this is the biggest we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the past century.'
b'Seriously, what is wrong with you'
b'There was a time before people knew how AIDS was transmitted. Even after it was known, people HIV+ were shunned. People absolutely were panicked about getting AIDS.'
b'> Asia/Hong Kong were both severe but fairly localised by comparison, H1N1 had far lower transmission rates, and AIDs is spread in a totally different way so isn\'t relevant at all.\n\nAre you for real? Are you above 20 and cant recon the amount of panic AIDS brought to the world then I\'m baffled tbh. That\'s something everyone should know.\n\nAsia and Hong kong you\'re just wrong about. You\'re literally in my field talking to me and trying to convice me how these outbreaks was "fairly localised". Alright.\n\nH1N1 we can talk a lot about and the numbers you\'re seeing today is not what numbers we saw during the outbreak, just like today?\n\n>This is looking to be as big as Spanish Flu in terms of infection, mortality will likely be a far lower rate due to medical advances, but in absolute terms this could kill more.\n\nCare to elaborate?\n\nEdit: It\'s funny because you\'re saying "None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type". Then you go on to say that AIDS is different etc. You do reckon which topic we\'re on right? What we know today is not relevant to how people reacted back then.'
b"> All of those diseases are fucking nothing compared to this lol, how some people still fail to see the path this is going to take baffles me.\n\nYou're saying that AIDS, H1N1, asian flu and hong kong flu was nothing compared to what we're seeing today? Are you for real? you must have a special narrative for what youre trying to push.\n\nBut still. My point is that we didnt know the numbers, how it spread, r0 til after the outbreak was done. And with AIDS people thought many different things before."
b"So what you're telling me is that we as a society have succeeded with better solutions etc? Seriously, you see what you want to see. We're literally watching the same thing unfold but while you see it as panic that these things are happening, I take it for granted for what I would want to see in a country/society year 2020. With our technology, reach with social media, giving so many people a voice, aircrafts with disinfectshit etc I would be so devastated if we didnt do anything at all to save these people. There is so much we can do today that we couldn't 1950 or so, why is it negative that we do it?"
b'Alright, show me the source for your claim then.'
b'> Seriously, what is wrong with you\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nEdit: For real tho. Why is it ok for doomers to say they wont talk with new account because chinaxD but I cant say the same about them? I dont understand tbh'
b"Yes I was around for the AIDS panic, doesn't sound like you were if you think it is transmitted in any way like the flu? \n\nIt was  primarily moral panic in the West, with vast amounts of ignorance and homophobia/racism behind it. This isn't that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure what you want me to elaborate on...the stats so far show transmission at Spanish Flu levels or thereabouts, but we have 7 times more people on the planet now. So if it were to infect the same % of population, but have a lower mortality rate, it could still easily cover the 50m that are attributed to Spanish Flu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe transmission stats are fact (based on current best evidence) the other two statements are obviously conjecture"
b"I've heard this has the possiblility of infecting 60-80% of the population... \n\nThat's like 5 billion or so people. At a conservative 2% mortality rate, that's 100,000,000 deaths. \n\nThis does NOT include those who die from starvation because of economic collapses, or those who can't get an ICU bed because they're all taken, etc...or medical scarcity of supplies like prescription drugs which also causes the weakest of society to suffer/die. \n\nBest case scenario, I think we end up w/ half these numbers because our govt's get their shit together, but some countries probably won't and it'll be worse there. I'm not an epidemiologist, but even w/ a vaccine will this possibly spin up w/ multiple variations every few years and need new vaccines? Will it cause more death at each spin up? Could this be the new normal? \n\nThe best assumptions right now are that hospital beds will be at max capacity in the USA by May 8th. After that, good luck if you have a life threatening emergency either COVID related or non-COVID related. \n\nHow many might die from COVID who'd survive IF they had ventilators/ICU beds available? I think we're gonna find out soon enough how bad this really will be, by May."
b"Just started watching today's video from [this dude](https://youtu.be/UVTyl7Y4IMo). He explicitly states that this is the worst health epidemic he's seen since beginning to practice in the 70s and goes into detail about why."
b"I'm saying exactly what I said/meant... SCOPE and SEVERITY of this outbreak hasn't been matched in 100+ years - not since the spanish flu. \n\nWe've just been lucky. My point being is, this could be just as deadly as that one was, no plague/etc since the Spanish Flu has scared the shit out of me like this one is... \n\nI mean if you get this, you could have irreparable lung damage, or the inability to breath consciously/autonomously. Not to mention, possibly other things we don't even know about yet, or if it mutates --who knows what it will be capable of. \n\nThis is the big one of  (my lifetime at least), as a 40 year old. \n\nNot denigrating Aids, etc, but mode of transmission for previous illnesses were a lot slower/harder/etc, this one on average each person getting it gives it to 2.4-2.9 people...which causes it to double every 6 days. \n\nThe USA isn't doing crap to curtail this, they aren't even testing or allowing tests. NY has the labs in place for 2k tests/day but the CDC isn't allowing them to test. It's as if the government wants to kill it's own, instead of risk having huge #'s of infections being reported."
b"The point is not Asian flu infected more people overall, Hong kong killed hundreds of thousands, SARS was more deadly, AIDS caused panic. \n\nThe point is if we let this get to the same scale as these others and beyond (and containment is harder because R0 is very high and human transmission is very easy), the damage, in terms of human lives, could be huge.\n\nThe point is not what it is now, it is where it's all heading in a year's time. It may be slowed down by warmer weather, the virus may weaken, it may become less contagious and so on...but we can't bank on such hopes."
b'I made an edit in my former post, I\'ll just post that.\n\nIt\'s funny because you\'re saying "None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type". Then you go on to say that AIDS is different etc. You do reckon which topic we\'re on right? What we know today is not relevant to how people reacted back then.\n\nPlese go back and read our thread. You\'re talking about things we know today. I dont see how that\'s relevant.'
b"> I've heard this has the possiblility of infecting 60-80% of the population...\n\nSource? You do realize that your post is invalid if you cant provide an actual source for that number right? Since you've based your entire post on bad math. Last I've heard was from Marc Lipsitch with 40-70% but he changed that to 20-60%. I'm not saying youre wrong per se, but please provide source."

b'I think the biggest issue is there are two types of people right now.

However, what he was told was wrong and has know brought possible harm to a lot of people.\n\nMy sister works in a hospital outside of chicago and when I asked her what they are doing about covid she basically laughed at me and said it was all scare tactics. She literally said she wont even think about it until she gets quarantined at her hospital.'
b"You know what. Your profs don't give a single f about those sites."

b'I wanted to write up on how my everyday life has changed in the last couple of months living in Korea. It\'s long but felt I wanted to share it with anyone who\'s interested.\n\n  \n\n\nHow we are dealing with CORVID-19.  \n  \nIt\'s been almost 2 months since most of my kids\' classes has stopped altogether. Some earlier than others, but for a month now, everything\'s been cancelled. School and kindergarten should\'ve started on Mar. 2nd. We\'ve been told they\'ll start on the 23rd, but one, it\'s possible they\'ll postpone the date again, and two, we don\'t know how we feel about sending the kids to school even if they actually do open. We\'re starting to worry about how this will affect the older boy\'s school work and education, and we try to give him some sort of homework for him to do, at least enough to keep him from forgetting stuff he learned in 1st grade. We had a teacher come and teach him math etc. for about 30 minutes every week, and give daily worksheet to do (fairly common in Korea). That 1 on 1 class is being held through a tablet app with video chat. Pretty cool, actually. Both kids are reading a lot of books, mostly because they get bored of playing all day. I get to read book after book after book for the little one, which I kind of like. They can\'t meet their friends which is pretty sad, and we are thankful that they have each other\'s company. I hear my colleagues with single child having much harder time trying to entertain their kids.  The younger one asks me about once a day if the Corona virus is gone yet. It breaks my heart a little bit. We all need a haircut, like last month. But we\'re just letting it grow since we probably would have to take our masks off during the cut (or at least during the shampoo process). At least the hairdressers are all working with their mask on. I know because I\'ve called them and asked. If words spread around the neighborhood that some restaurants or stores have employess working without masks on, that store\'s going to have zero customers. \n  \nMy wife is a SAHM and she\'s been spending time with the two kids 24/7. They go out for a walk about once week if the weather\'s nice, all with their mask on. It\'s actually not that bad since there are few people on the street and nearby trails (other than dog owners walking their dogs). They get to take the mask off and breath in some fresh air, which is probably due to China stopping a lot of their factories leading to cleaner air in Korea. The boys (8 and 4) have learned to enjoy each other\'s company since it is their only option. They get along much better and that\'s some burden off of my wife\'s shoulders. We don\'t go out to malls or anywhere indoor at all. We used to be able to online order fresh food before midnight and they\'d be on our front door at 7am the next day, but now they\'re often sold out. We have succeeded in ordering some stuff when we order early in the afternoon or so. We take turns going to the grocery, alone, again with our mask. I try to let her go as often as I can, so she can get at least a little time by herself, even if it\'s for a short drive to and from the store. We find ourselves buying less of fresh veggies and parishables because we don\'t want to goto the store often. We end up buying more frozen food than we\'d like. She\'s come up with so many creative ways to pass the time with the kids, often transforming normal house chores into some kind of a game, but we both agree options are running out. She\'s very tired all the time and we\'re just waiting for all this to pass.  \n  \nA lot of companies in Korea have decided to have their employees work from home. That is not the case where I work, but it could change in an instant if any one of our employees turn up to be confirmed of the virus. For now, masks are mandatory. Riding the company bus, taking the elevator, walking through halls, etc. all require masks. We have a big sign in the elevator that reads, "NO MASK, NO ELEVATOR". Koreans already tend to wear mask often when they have a cold or something, but now, you get weird looks if you\'re not wearing one within the company. Sanitizers are everywhere and we\'ve gotten acustomed to just sanitizing our hands whenever we see one, without giving it a second thought. I\'ve probably used it around 30 times today. In addition, when we goto the cafetaria, there are employees with sanitizers in both hands spraying every single employees before we get in. A few days ago, we had a plastic, transparent wall installed on our cafetaria table for every spot so people eating facing each other are blocked from any unecessary droplet infection. Most social and non-essential meetings have been either cancelled, delayed or are held over phones.  We have thermo-camera things set up so everyone entering the company gets their temperatures checked, and one of our employee goes around the office taking everyone\'s temperature twice a day. People in hazmat-like suit came in the other day to disinfect/fumigate the whole office and we had to leave for 30+ minutes, which was nice because the coffee place closest to the office closed down after the whole virus thing. We were able to walk to a coffee place further away and finally get some good coffee. We didn\'t talk much because we\'d lower our mask only to take a sip of the coffee. They say it\'s going to be a weekly event. Most business trips have stopped, especially to China. \n  \nWe get several text messages from the goverment regarding CORVID-19. It used to be used for national emergencies such as earthquake warnings, heat warnings, etc. But nowadays, they\'re all about the virus. If a confirmed case in my city is found, the city immediately messages everyone (I do mean everyone in the city. I think it\'s a feature in all Korean phones and cannot be opted out) the patient\'s age/gender/location(down to which section of the city) and where they\'ve gone in the last few days or so. It gets down to specific restaurant\'s name. We also get general reminders for washing hands, wearing masks, and not attending religious/social meetings. Starting today (9th of March), we received messages on how to go about purchasing masks.  \n  \nMasks have been a huge part of our lives for the last month or so. We take them off at home, in our own cars, and in my cubicle while working (but I do keep them Butabout half the time even in my cubicle, just in case). We hear KF80, KF94 (probably a Korean mask filter-ability standard, not sure what the global standards are) are preferable, but I do have a couple hundreds of the cheap disposable ones that I bought a few weeks before the virus broke out (the ones that surgeons use), so I just use those and dispose of them after a day of use. My main concern is my habit of touching my face inadvertantly and people coughing/sneezing close to me. All the mask you can buy online are either sold out, or have gone up crazy in price. Ones we used to be able to get for less than $1 USD costs $3~5. Because of this, Korean government decided to limit Korean mask manufacturers on how much they can export compared to domestic sales (I think it was more than 90% but not sure), and the government is buying most of the mask themselves to sell to the people for reasonable price. Basically, it\'s martial law for mask sales. They tried a few methods (which had loopholes, obviously) and seem to have decided on the current method.  \n  \n2 masks per person a week. They are sold ONLY at the pharmacy, because they already have system to make sure people aren\'t perscribed medication repeatedly. Simply put, they punch in your national ID number, and they can see if you\'ve bought your ration of your masks for the week. You also have to be there in person, unless you\'re buying masks for kids 10 years or younger, or 80 or older person that you live with. Even then, it has to be your day. For example, I was born in 19x2. This means my day is Tuesday. I can buy two on Tuesday only. My son was born 2012. I can bring an official document that proves that we live together. Then I can buy 4, including 2 for my son. My wife can buy 4 on another day of the week (Monday) because she was born in 19x1, and my younger son was born in 2016 (1,6 on Monday, 2,7 on Tuesday, etc.). I will be stopping by my local pharmacy to pick up 4 masks for the kids tomorrow. This is the first week of the policy and I\'m sure there will be confusion everywhere, but I think it\'s a reasonable plan. I personally don\'t think the masks I already have are inadequate, but you don\'t know how long this CORVID-19 will last so I\'d like to buy them while I can.  \n  \nAll in all, our life has gotten much more unconfortable, but as people do, we\'ve gotten used to it. We try to watch the news on TV but turn them off pretty quickly because it makes everyone sad. I do keep up with the news online for Korea and around the world. Everyone around me agrees that if it wasn\'t for that cult, we\'d be in much better condition as a whole. We start fuming and cursing whenever the cult comes up in our conversation, and half-jokingly ask people around us to repeat the phrase, "FUCK Lee Man Hwee". He\'s the head of the cult, and "obviously" you won\'t be able to say so if you\'re part of the cult. Probably not true, but got to entertain ourselves somehow.\n\nEdit: I\'m adding small bits here and there to the text to mention any additional things that comes to mind.'
b'Finding a job without a global epidemic is hard enough, this thing is prob gonna screw up my job search even worse.

b'I live in North Texas & I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like anyone I know, personally, actually understands what is going on. \n\nToday on my Facebook feed, these are things I saw (all by different people in my area):\n\n1. The flu is worse, there\xe2\x80\x99s only been 164 infections in the US per the CDC (posted by a local MD at our hospital & shared a couple hundred times by his patients & coworkers)\n\n2. People die of heart disease every day, people are dying of cancer...no one cares about that but you all want to panic over this over hyped virus \xf0\x9f\x99\x84\n\n3. In America, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to call into work if they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well anyway, so who cares, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of canceling big events \n\n4. (After posting how thrilled I was about SXSW) (random commenter) \xe2\x80\x9cWell you\xe2\x80\x99re a genius aren\xe2\x80\x99t you! You let the media tell you everything! I bet you don\xe2\x80\x99t even leave your house during flu season!!\xe2\x80\x9d *side note*: I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news & I literally just said i was glad they had canceled SXSW...\n\n5. I posted some compiled stats, was told I was wrong according to the CDC, proved myself correct with sources & was then told I was \xe2\x80\x9cfear mongering\xe2\x80\x9d & \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s okay if people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what you believe.\xe2\x80\x9d   *...it\xe2\x80\x99s not a belief though, it\xe2\x80\x99s scientific fact...but okay*\n\n6. ThE fLu Is WoRsE (RN x 2)\n\nThis. Was. Just. Today. \n\nNo one takes it seriously, no one is willing to take ANY extra precautions to protect themselves, so they especially don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone else. Even medical staff thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had like two counties in our state test people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared that if someone I love catches this, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to receive the care they need, because where I live, this has nothing to do with science & is 100% a partisan issue.'
b'What is the deal with newspapers paywalling coronavirus info? Since some science journals have unlocked their articles concerning coronavirus, I feel like journals should do so too, just to keep the public informed and reduce panic. Is anyone interested in petitioning someone like the NYT to make their coronavirus articles free?'
b'I\'ve been noticing quite a few posts by (understandably) confused Americans who are wondering why people on this sub are "panicking" about coronavirus if it "only kills the elderly/compromised" and saying that we are "misinformed." I realize that a lot of folks are new to this sub so I wanted to give this quick PSA:\n\n**There is a difference between individual risk and systemic risk. Government messaging tends to focus on the former. This sub tends to focus on the latter.**\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThis is a new virus with a lot of moving parts and a lot of unknowns. Sure, all data points currently point to high survival/recovery rates for young, healthy individuals. **No sane person on this sub is disputing this.** The issue that a lot of us are trying to underscore is that, regardless of the effect that the virus will have on you *personally*, it has the potential to create real issues for healthcare systems which are not designed to handle a surge of hospitalizations/ICU patients. And even more to the point, once that system hits a breaking point, all bets are off.\n\n[This is already happening in Italy as I type this.](https://twitter.com/RachelDonadio/status/1236760190592192514)\n\nThis is why they, like China, [have decided to lockdown 16 million people.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/08/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-europe-intl/index.html)\n\nAgain, I don\'t think any sane person on this sub thinks people should "panic" in the capital P sense of the word. I certainly don\'t want anyone to panic. But it *is* important for the general population to start looking beyond how this virus will affect them individually to see the greater issues involved.\n\nWe are all in this together.  And simply dismissing any article that attempts to highlight systemic risk as "fearmongering" or "misinformation" isn\'t helping. Systemic risks are scary. We get it. But being aware of them is important because it allows each of us to make different daily choices to keep ourselves and those we love safe.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n**Edit**: Just got a DM asking why the government isn\'t saying what I\'m saying if this is "such a big deal." The answer is simple. **Dealing with individual risks is the responsibility of the citizens. Dealing with systemic risk is the responsibility of the government.** At least in theory. This is why elections matter. This is also why journalism matters. It is up to journalists to ask hard questions about how the government is navigating systemic risk. And it is up to the citizens to hold their governments accountable when those answers fall short.'

b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a student at Yale School of Drama and the university has cancelled all gatherings over 100 people.

b'I also wanted to share my observations  from being out in public these past few days. I live in Westchester County, an affluent suburb of New York City. For the last week we have seen (Westchester alone) the cases of this virus jump from 1-100 people in a week (due to our representatives fighting for tests). I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed many people doing due diligence when it comes to hand hygiene. I was on line at the atm. No one use the hand sanitizer that was available at the door. People were scratching their faces. At a yoga class where we used props, balls and weights, the teacher made a point to wipe down mats but didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother with balls or weights. Right after we left the class another group came in and immediately took balls and weights that were just used and not sanitised.  \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.

b"3-month internship in Germany ends in April, thinking of leaving earlier due to Coronavirus, would like a second opinion\n\nI'm from the USA and live with my parents (59-60 years old). I recently got accepted to a 3 month internship in Germany and already 2 months into it. Been living in temporary travel hostels (4-6 bed dorms).\n\nDue to the increasing COVID scare, I'm thinking of leaving early to reduce my chances of catching the virus. I brought this up to my boss via email, and we had an in-person talk today. Basically my boss said I should not panic, it's not gonna be a big deal, etc. I state that I'm not worried about myself, but rather my elderly parents catching the virus when I go back. The risk is low but I'd rather not take it. My boss tells me to calm down and think over it, if I want to I can book a flight and leave early. Talked to US Embassy in Germany, they don't really have any answers for me.\n\nSorry if this is not the right subreddit but should I just go early? I mean the internship would be nice but I'm really scared of 1) spreading any potential virus to my parents and 2) not being able to go back to the US if it gets really bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr\n\n* US citizen lived with 60 year old parents at home\n* Currently 3 month internship in Germany ending in April 1st\n* Original plan to leave on April 7 (light travelling beforehand)\n* Want to leave early - March 12 or March 13\n* Boss told me to calm down, it's not a big deal in Germany right now and not to panic\n* Staying in travellers' hostel in Berlin, 4-6 bed dorms"
b'There is a Facebook post going around from a member of the Infectious Disease Association of California which seems extremely helpful -- lots of scientific information -- but I don\'t see anyone posting it publicly. I hope some scientists or doctors can speak directly to media about the data being shared (quote: "Co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses like Influenza or RSV is <=2%, interpret that to mean if you have a positive test for another respiratory virus, then you do not test for COVID-19.

My wife and I have been discussing whether I should cancel or not, and if I do cancel, if they should come back earlier (we're all supposed to come back home to Italy on April 17th). \n\nWhile I'm not worried that I'm infected, I'm afraid of maybe catching something at the airport or on the plane and bringing that to my elderly in-laws. I'm also worried that if I do go and have symptoms I'll be in a lot worse situation in the states since I don't have insurance, while here I'm covered. And finally, I'm worried that my and wife and daughter might get stuck there too. \n\nI'd much rather us be in Italy than the US if things get bad since we live in a smaller seaside town where I think cases are less likely, not to mention the fact that we all have health coverage.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?

b'Hi all, Question. My spouse & I have air travel planned next week to attend a festival in a city where there are currently NO coronavirus cases.\n\nThere are cases in our area. From a moral standpoint, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spread the virus if I am a carrier.  Also, If I do contract it from community spread at home, I would want to be quarantined at home, not in a city across the country. \n\nWe are not afraid of getting sick - we are healthy and in our late 20s - but we are afraid of the potential of being grounded in that city for an extended period of time. \n\nQuestions:\n(1) If I needed to be quarantined in another city, I would be SOL as far as cost coverage, right? I assume I would not be moved to a military base for recovery like the cruise ship passengers. Unless my condition required hospitalization, I would need to pay out of pocket for hotel costs. Private health insurance, home insurance, umbrella insurance would not cover that. Is this right? \n\n(2) We are concerned about the possibility of not being able to return home easily. While flights probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be grounded, is it possible that certain airports will not accept flights if the virus is bad enough in that city? \n\nWe really wanted to go on this trip but we are wondering if the responsible thing to do - from a financial and time perspective - would be to skip it, since it seems like shit is hitting the fan fast.

If someone with the virus kisses you and you get 100,000 units of virus at once  is that the same as if you breath in 10 units of virus from a cough 6 feet away?

b"Now, assuming eventually getting infected is inevitable as an American (which isn't true, but as the situation unravels it seems like trying to avoid the virus for months on end will become less and less practical for a lot of people)... Would it actually be in my best interest as a young, healthy adult to get infected as early on in the course of the outbreak as possible? (also assuming I'm successful in not infecting anyone else)\n\n[https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/](https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/)\n\nHear me out. According to epidemiologist Trevor Bedford, the virus mutates at an average rate of once per two weeks. The transmission rate is roughly once per week from incubation to transmission to the next host, so you can think of the virus gaining a new point mutation between every two infections on average. The first case sequenced in the US on Jan 15 was found to be the ancestor of another case sent in on Feb 28, with 3 new point mutations in between. So my other question is: over time, will the mutations that increase the virus' hardiness/destructiveness be selected for? Right now the odds of the virus killing a young, healthy person like myself are very low, so if I were to get infected early, take all precautions, quarantine myself etc. until I've recovered and gained antibodies/immunity, would I most likely be immune to potentially more dangerous strains that emerge in the future? Does the immunity just last until the virus mutates in the epitope region? How quickly is this thing evolving compared to other recent epidemic viruses?"

b'Why do people say that this is all an over reaction and the common flue killed more people. They do not take it serious. I hear this especially from good friends and family members,\n\nI try to explain them the points like that this is just the beginning, that this is a novel corona virus, and that the infection rate is very high. I also tell them that the fatality rate is also higher. But they take nothing serious and play down the whole situation.\n\nThey compare absolute numbers from the common flue when the fatalaty rate was extraordinary high with the current available data from SARS-CoV-19. I could go crazy when I hear that. Sometimes they not even try to talk about the highs of the common flue. They simply say that the common flue kills more people than corona. This is not true. They do not even know the exact name of the virus. Almost nobody.\n\nThey also say, when I tell them my arguments, "what should we do? Should we stay home all the time". I never said something like that. I tell them to be onlu more cautious and wash their hands better.\n\nAnd this are only two examples of such discussions.\n\nI do not understand such an behavior. They only thing about themselfs. Such an behavior is egoistic and irresponsable. One could transport the virus to someone loved. This person could be responsible for the death of other people. I know that this is the worst case. You could be the one who let other persons have a really hard time in hospitals.\n\nThey let me stay in discussion like i am overacting or overreacting. But I think they are the real morons when they laugh at people who take also real care on others.\n\nThis are people who almost never stop to speak to others and give advice over advice. They spread ignorance, disinformation, lies and could give other people a dalse sense of the situation. Such people could be also responsible for deaths of other people no having contact with since they talk to other so much.\n\nI am wheather a professional and not a scary person.

This was reported about a week ago, and no new cases have been confirmed by the university. \nHowever I'm a bit skeptical and not sure why classes aren't cancelled yet, since many businesses are telling their employees to work from home already.

b"Questions to people in the UK. Excuse my English.\n\nI just read a post on Facebook about the Corona virus in the UK by a Vietnamese (my country) woman who is living in London. She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously, they still think this is just a normal flu, people still hanging around without a mask. She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus. It's very hard to buy a mask too, the price is getting higher. And if you have the symptoms of the virus, u call 111, but if you don't have all the symptoms (fever, cough, pneumonia) then the doctor won't come to test you. Her Vietnamese friend had to pretend that her symptoms were very serious (coughing on the phone etc..) and she get tested, but the result came after 3 days (!!!). If the result is positive then you have to self quarantined at home, there would be a phone call everyday but nothing more, you gonna be okay anyway. The person with the virus cannot go to the hospital unless it's very serious because they are afraid that they will spread it to other doctors and patients.\n\nIs that all true? Well you can't believe everything on social media so I'm here to ask. Hope to get a honest answer. Thank you"

b'My sister came home yesterday from work saying that one of her coworkers felt sick and was saying she might have the virus. She works at a pizza place and my husband and I were pissed because I stopped by to grab a free pizza from her and her coworker was there. We asked her to tell her manager but my husband thinks we should maybe call the CDC? What are we supposed to do in this situation? There\xe2\x80\x99s 12 potential cases in my area right now so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why someone would be joking about having it. Also my grandparents came over yesterday so we were kind of freaking out. Why are people so stupid and inconsiderate?'

b'Does anyone know of a chart or data set that actually shows the breakdown by age of how many people are hospitalized, or killed? \n\nAll I can seem to find is the same old charts from weeks ago showing .2% death rate for 10 - 40 year olds.  I wonder if this is even accurate anymore and want to see absolute real numbers of death rate and hospitalization rate.  Seems suspicious that this is so hard to find anywhere.'
b"My parents came back from Ecuador 3 weeks ago and have developed a sickness which they have only dismissed as the common cold. All they've told me is they don't have the coronavirus symptoms instead. They don't believe they are at risk for coronavirus at all. Am I crazy to think they should get tested?"
b"Hi guys,  \n\n\nI've got an unusual question. I'm a volunteer at the animal shelter in Warsaw. I'm wondering if there is anyone on Reddit, who deals with the same stuff in Italy, France, Germany or other countries, where people already started to panic.\n\nMaybe some volunteers will notice my comment - if not, do you know where I should ask? I'm new here. Or maybe you have some friends who help at shelters and you can ask? I've got three questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Do adoptions still take place or is it close to zero now?\n2. 2. Have people started to abandon their pets more frequently in this situation?\n3. 3. How do you make sure you don't get infected when you're where? Do you have any procedures?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need to know it, because here, in Poland, people don't care about the situation and are not aware of the fact that it will strike us with great power. We seem not to have any procedures for this case and I can't imagine just leaving those poor dogs and cats with no support.\n\nThank you!"

b"This article is a bit old for today, but still.\n\n When the information on coronavirus outbreak in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan was officially confirmed, social networks were filled with messages from schoolers, their parents and school teachers. Turned out that local schools had strict rules regarding school uniforms, the color of medical masks that can be worn in school in case of an epidemy was also limited by said rulkes to plain white only.  \n\n\n\\>The problem of the shortage of medical masks in the country has not yet been solved; will it be allowed to wear a pale pink mask at school if the parents did not find a white mask? This issue was submitted to the school board and it was decided to make an indulgence. Was there a need for such a discussion? Now you can wear colored masks.  \n\n\n\\>It was difficult to find medical masks to supply them with a child. The next day, he said that masks of any color other than white were against the school rules. It could be considered a rebellion against school rules, but plain whire masks are still nowhere to be found. Fortunately, in the first-aid post provided the child with a mask of white color, so the problem was solved.  \n\n\n\\>The child had to ignore the school rule against wearing masks that are not white, yet at the same time those people who simply coughed without a mask can be detained in the subway.  \n\n\n\\>It's understandable when we don't allow kids to wear expensive or flashy clothes to school to not attract too much attention, but what about imposing restrictions on the color of the mask at such situation? I believe the school will have to keep responsibility if someone gets infected because of this.  \n\n\n\\>In the end, on February 23, the Kumamoto City Department of Education had to make an official statement in which educational institutions were advised: during the period of infection, schools should not limit the color of masks worn by students.  \n\n\nSources:  \n[https://9post.tv/284983](https://9post.tv/284983)  \n[https://j-cast.com/trend/2020/02/25](https://j-cast.com/trend/2020/02/25)380517.html"

b"Is it possible that this virus has a delayed effect like HIV/AIDS? Could we hear that coronavirus 'survivors' are dying from the virus in a year? Or is this virus unlikely to cause any concern after its gone?"
b'I keep seeing this meme get shared on Facebook with blatant misinformation in it:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/qJmCLBl'
b"PSA: Check out resources offered by your library/school - they might include free access to different news articles and other stuff to keep you occupied/updated. For example, the Toronto Public Library offers a free 3-day pass to the New York Times website that you can renew as many times as you want. McGill offers access to PressReader, where I found the Toronto Star, the Wall Street Journal, Globe and Mail, and National Post. They both offer access to Kanopy, where you can find a lot of cool documentaries and lectures! I've noticed that a lot of my fellow Torontonians/students don't know about these features, but I'm pretty sure they're fairly common if you live in a big city/attend a big university"
b'I presume nobody would know the answer to this, but for example, I live like half a block from a city park that has a big field and a playground. I see people mentioning that they get to go out for walks and things during a quarantine, so I\'ve been hanging my hope on the belief that it would "comply" with any quarantine for us to still take our kids to the park, so we are not trapped inside all day with them. This is the US and I don\'t know if we\'ll ever actually do anything to quarantine people... but I guess hypothetically, would that be "ok" generally, or are you "supposed" to literally stay in your house as much as possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could see it being "ok" because it\'s outside and spread out, but obviously, if everyone is doing that, especially the kids, they\'d just be transmitting everything between themselves and then taking it home for their parents.'
b'Guys im having sore throat ,runny nose and sneezing but i have no fever \nCould i possibly have ncov?'
b"How long does it take to recover from coronavirus? I don't have it, but I'd like to know in case I do get it, since I have a convention next Saturday that I've been looking forward to for months."
b'So ... I seem to have most of the symptoms including a cough (but it is "wet" due to acute bronchitis) ... plus I have had diarrhea over the past 2 days. However ... no fever. And other then an international flight and a pass through Heathrow, have not been in any red flag zones.\nAny opinions?'
b"This image shows how European countries (ignoring Italy which is a special case) are totally failing at fighting COVID-19.\n\nDespite a whole one month's head start, they are almost all about to overtake Hong Kong in terms of cases per head of population:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Qew8zee.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qew8zee.png)\n\nGraphic made with this site:\n\n[http://www.casualhacker.net/covid19-spread/growth.html](http://www.casualhacker.net/covid19-spread/growth.html)\n\nPlease spread far and wide to your media and your social media, this will help them understand as most media are totally clueless on this virus.\n\nBig action is needed now by governments! Stop all large gatherings, close schools and universities, issue masks, lock down regions with the biggest clusters, force companies to offer remote working if they can. Go to war with virus instead of 'waiting for summer' - there is no evidence this virus will just disappear then, nor is there evidence that there will suddenly be a critical care bed for everyone who needs one then. Governments must go to war with the virus NOW and not delay."
b'United States infection and death numbers are probably underestimated due to a lack of medical care. Many Americans will not go to the hospital because they cannot afford to pay. If you complicate that with the possibility of being quarantined and receiving death threats from panicked  Americans, it becomes a recipe for avoiding hospitals as long as possible.'
b'When is Idaho going to report numbers? If anyone believes its zero, their only fooling themselves. Why have we had 6 suspected cases for over a week with no updates and 4 in quarantine at BSU and no confirmation or otherwise.... why is our state not reporting? Are we just not testing? People are getting very concerned!'
b"Any idea why Germany hasn't had any deaths yet? Are they treating severe patients differently? This would be very helpful information. I am very surprised there is so little information available about this."

b'Thank you for sharing. This is insightful for some of us that are a month or two behind.'
b"Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.  The president is more concerned about controlling the information and making everything seem like it's fine instead of trying to protect Americans at all costs.\n\nBtw I love how they told us all masks wouldn't do anything to help."
b'This is really interesting thanks so much for sharing. What strikes me, particularly, is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the UK being anywhere near this organised and disciplined.'
b"It looks like South Korea may very well be winning the fight against the virus.  Your daily new cases has dropped from 272 to 165 (the lowest in 2 weeks).

b'Thank you for sharing your experience. I appreciate that you took the time to write about it and share it with us.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little worrying elsewhere imagining that more of us may find ourselves in a similar situation soon.\n\nAt least we\xe2\x80\x99ll all know we\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in our efforts and difficulties. There\xe2\x80\x99s an irony in feeling together in staying apart.\n\nI hope that treatments for serious cases will gradually improve as we learn more about this disease, and the rate of transmission will slow partially because we\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to contain it, and eventually a good portion of the population may recover from it and be immune and unable to catch or spread the same version again. \n\nIf we can try to slow the rate of spread enough to keep up with treating the most serious cases and try to isolate the most vulnerable from getting it until that time, then things may work out pretty well.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but we do know that this probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be forever, and life will move forward eventually.'

b'Very insightful, thanks for sharing. It shows how you guys are taking a bottoms up cultural approach to combating the virus (eg no mask, no elevator) and the text messaging system. It also shows how absolutely unprepared Western countries are. \n\nIf President Moon had also taken a firmer approach once the virus had spread, you guys would be much better off too.'

b'The point is not that this is a super dangerous disease for each individual, in particular if you\'re young and healthy. And this is the panicky feeling I get from some.\n\nThe point is that this disease could easily overwhelm our health care systems which would increase the all cause mortality. If the hospital is over capacity, you can\'t deal with a stroke as efficiently as you would otherwise...\n\nAnd the second point is something the "it\'s just the flu" crowd can\'t see.\n\nYes, with appropriate care only a very small percentage of sick people will die from it but if this new disease spreads too quickly, appropriate care won\'t be possible.'

b'I\'ve never understood this whole "the flu is worse" like ok yh alot of people do die of the flu a year but the flue has been around for alot longer and we know what to expect. Coronavirus on the other hand is a new disease and no one knows shit about it we\'re still researching the coronavirus to see just how bad it is. Not to mention we have a vaccine for the flu and for the coronavirus a vaccine is atleast a year away if not longer. Lastly you just need to look at how fast coronavirus is spreading every day and most research points to the coronavirus having a higher death rate then the flu. \nNot to mention with more and more people getting infected everyday we could potentially see a massive increase in the death rate within the next few weeks'
b'I am in shock about how people are not taking this seriously.  Just look at Northern Italy right now, what makes anyone think that can\xe2\x80\x99t/won\xe2\x80\x99t happen in our communities?!

b"I'm an hour from DW and have been complaining about this daily. They put out a press release saying they'd be open and train staff accordingly but they already are super hygienic.

b'Hi, I graduated from Columbia in 2018. It\xe2\x80\x99s always a pleasure for me to come across another fellow lion. First of all, please allow me to express my sympathy. Now, I am really wondering about this: A lot of 300-people-enrolled classes usually have on-site finals. What will happen to these finals? Also, will on-campus housing shut down?

Any answers you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.'
b"From what I understand, corona is an enveloped virus, which can be destroyed with alcohol. Non enveloped viruses such as norovirus, aren't susceptible to alcohol as a disinfectant. That being said, handwashing trumps hand sanitizer."
b"SciShow youtube said the virus envelope is fat based so soap really tears it apart. the alcohol in sanitize would work also.\n\nJust like hand washing when you use a sanitizer it has to stay wet while you're 'lathering' it around for a minimum of 20 seconds for clinical effect. Smaller amounts will still dry you out and therefore feel effective but it takes 20 seconds so don't skimp."

b"Speaking from one of the hospitals in the Seattle area, we do not allow visitors for suspected and confirmed Covid patients. The hospitals in this area also have the same policy. One of my nightmares is that my parents get it, are hospitalized, and I wouldn't be able to see them again."
b"If I'm able/allowed to visit, absolutely. I'll wash my hands thoroughly before & after, but I'm not in a high-risk category; I'm not very worried about myself. And I know I can help my parents de-stress significantly, which will help them recover.\n\nEdit: A lot of it would depend on circumstances, though. Some folks don't have good/close relationships with their parents, some aren't able to travel to where their parents would be, some folks are at higher risk or live with folks at higher risk & it may not be worth the risk for them, etc. I wouldn't judge folks who chose differently than me; this is just *my* answer.\n\nSecond edit: Also for the record, everyone should always wash their hands before & after any hospital visit. Before, for the sake of the folks being treated there, and after, for your own sake & those around you at home."
b"Several Japanese medical personnel that interacted with the Diamond Princess are coming up positive sometime later, and these are people versed in infection control PPE usage.\n\n\nBut again this is your loved ones your family, you can't just turn your back at a time of need. \n\n\nThat's a very good question"
b"My parents? Lol no. If they wanted sympathy on their death beds they probably shouldn't have put their cigarettes out on my chest.\n\nBut let's say your relationship with your parents is normal. What good is visiting them going to do? They will be in isolation. It's not like you can go in and talk to them without wearing full PPE. You can maybe tap on their window and wave or something, but it's probably better to just Skype with them if they aren't intubated."

b'You are the parents and you make the decisions. Sometimes you make mistakes as a parent, but I know your heart is in the right place when you made this decision in trying to protect your family and others, so even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good mistake. Your lives and your kids lives can\xe2\x80\x99t be replaced, schoolwork can. I say you made the right call as we wait to see what will happen. They can always make up the work or do summer school if need be. Good luck.'

b"The u.s. is just starting to break out cases. We are not testing on purpose to keep our numbers low but that won't last forever. I think you and your spouse will be vindicated in the next month. The kids can always make up their learning."
b'It is a really tough call.  My wife and I are also in Oregon.  We talked tonight and were torn on sending the kids to school tomorrow.  We decided to keep them home.  I already work from home so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep them off screens and have them do Kahn Academy, books, and documentaries.  It is only a two day week for parent teacher conferences.  I think a combination of the lack of testing and the middle school being kept open in Hillsboro was what pushed me over the edge.  We aren\xe2\x80\x99t that worried but both kids took turns being sick last week and now I have the sore throat and cough my oldest did.  Pretty sure my oldest had RSV and not Covid but staying home seems like the safer move for everyone.'
b'I just bought a little extra of what i normally buy in case my household is quarantined or supplies become limited because of factories closing or limited importing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have major stockpiles, but just for example, an extra package of paper towels instead of just the one i normally keep. A little extra cleaning supplies, toiletries, food that i would eat anyway, meds i use, dog food.\n\nI have the ability to keep my house running just as before for at least a full month or so without shopping. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for long term power or water outages because so far that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an issue in even the hardest hit places.\n\nThe plan is to keep this extra safety barrier up for a year or so, i guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll know if it gets eradicated sooner. I think it will come back hard in the fall.'
b'Disinfectant with 75% or more ethanol or alcohol with a high alcohol content such as spiritus. \nThese disinfectants can be used not only for disinfecting hands, but also for wiping places where everyone can touch, such as doorknobs and light switches.\nSpiritus should be diluted with purified water to 75% alcohol.'

b"Swine flu broke out in Mexico in April and spread through the United States by way of Texas and California. It came at the end of flu season and wasn't as destructive as it could have been thanks to a warm summer and it mutating to a less deadly strain. \n\nCorona broke out in China in December in the middle of winter. Spread way too fast into Europe and Asia. We have to survive another 2 months before warmer weather can slow down the outbreak. Also, the mortality rate is insanely high (3%) in the over 60 demographic. That's terrifying when you consider the flu is like .1%"

We're not going to let family members visit loved ones in hospitals,  hospice,  etc?   \n\nI hear what you're saying,  I just don't see how we implement it."
b"It's so easy to say it, but now try to implement."
b'Better safe than sorry.'
b"Tbh it's no wonder it's spreading so much given how the NHS are responding.\n\nMe and my partner just got back from Amsterdam, now he's got a temperature, cough and headache. Called 111 and was told by someone at PHE that I needed to speak to someone from 111 and get a test organised as people have been coming back from there with cases. Get through to 111 guy who basically says they can't do anything unless you've been to one of the countries on their list. Which is ridiculous if you've been through any airport as you have more than likely been close to someone who HAS been to one of those places. There's definitely way more cases than they think there are if they're flat out ignoring anyone who hasn't been to Italy Iran China or South Korea."
b"How do you get in contact with someone who has been diagnosed, if they don't diagnose anyone?"
b'With proper protection, infection is preventable. After the first devastating wave, no doctor get infected in Wuhan. So I guess dentist well be fine if they use proper protection. However for the safety concerns, most dental clinics in China is still close waiting for further notice.'
b"From what I've read (afraid I don't have links handy), a lot of it is exhaustion or dehydration; I know workers in China at least knew they were short on protective gear and would avoid drinking (which would require changing out their gear) as long as they could, sometimes too long. And I've seen at least one person in Italy talking about working 40-hr shifts, so exhaustion is definitely a factor. And the repeated exposure means they're very likely to get it eventually, though I don't know that it drives their immune system haywire. And when they do get it, because of the exhaustion and possible dehydration, some will get a bad case of it, and their healthcare systems are already overwhelmed so they can't get good care, so... it's a compounding issue."
b'Because if the economy fails he has no basis for his re-election'
b"Money. It's always money. He knows a recession will make it harder to win re-election."
b"We don't know yet. There's some reports of re-infection, but those could've been folks who just hadn't fully recovered from the initial infection. It also remains to be seen how much it mutates/how impactful those mutations are."
b'Why get worried about it?  i accept it as fact.'
b'Cultures differ. This disease might change the way people view the use of masks.\n\nThat said, there are concerns about shortages of masks for medical workers, and guidance on the use of masks seems to differ by country.\n\nYou probably should follow the recommendations from health experts and officials, and try not to worry about what other people think either way.'
b'Who could have known?'
b'Which island?\n\nMy island (Oahu) has about a million people and two positive tests. I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get a lot more and wish they\xe2\x80\x99d act now. But shit\xe2\x80\x99s going to explode. :/\n\nI wish you luck. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard living in an isolated place rn'

b'If I have 10 ICU beds in a hospital, and the average admitted CV patient takes up 21 days worth of ICU, then I can only treat 173 patients a year.  If all 173 show up on Monday, then 163 are fucked.'
b'All else equal, social distancing and quarantines should be expected to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby the rate of spread.\n\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t catch a disease if you\xe2\x80\x99re never near any source of it.\n\nAlthough the efforts so far haven\xe2\x80\x99t been effective in stopping the spread of the disease entirely, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a reason to give up. Slowing down the rate of spread gives us more time to prepare and ensure those who become seriously ill get proper treatment.'

b'Wikipedia is a great place to start.  SARS had about 8,000 cases and 800 deaths.  From the time it started showing up in significant numbers it took about 3 months to reach this peak.  SARS was also easier to contain since it did not spread until people had a fever and even then there weren\xe2\x80\x99t droplets.  Anyway, this outbreak already has an order of magnitude more cases and almost five times the number of deaths and it is just getting started.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\xe2\x80\x9304_SARS_outbreak'

b'Ask yourself how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel if one or more of your family members got sick and you were quarantined in the city. Do you have a good stock of food in the city? That\xe2\x80\x99s a LOT of roommates. Imagine being quarantined with them vs. having a yard and dogs (!!!) and family for support. You\xe2\x80\x99re not overthinking this.'
b'The only thing to fear is the lack of fear itself.'
b"Absolutely. The smartest thing would be to not have big events with lots of people close to each other. It will spread, reguardless of if it done intentionally or not. Trump is 73, Bernie is 78, Biden is 77. Not good ages for catching this, especially if they have any pre-existing conditions.\n\nI imagine no hand shakes, keep people 6+ ft away at times... Maybe we see secret service freak out and tackle someone for sneezing or coughing lol who knows. \n\nYou're right though, people who are famous/in positions of power have a really high chance of catching this."
b"Yea the dorm situation is not good for spreading an illness. However, neither is traveling through crowded airports to get home to you parents. I would not leave to avoid getting sick as getting home you very well may pick it up and then spread it to your parents. If your main concern is being stuck in Germany while sick but would rather be home, that's another thing. If you do come home, I would self quaratine for 14 days before visiting with friends and family and airports are hotspots. (especially if you're concerned about your parents getting sick.)\n\nYou're allowed to do whatever you want for personal reasons."
b'The Government should never be your role models'
b"We don't really know yet."
b'It might spread slower in warm weather. Australia and south America will show us in the coming weeks'
b"We don't know.\n\nTypically, but not always, respiratory viruses like coronavirus or the flu slow down in hotter more humid weather.\n\nIt's reasonable to think that's probably going to be the case now with this virus, but there's currently no direct evidence that it will happen."
b"We don't have data on Covid-19's longevity at temperature yet.\n\nBut similar viruses persist for days at 30C on various surfaces.\n\n [https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext)"
b"Currently experiments indicated the virus will be killed fast at temperature of 56 celsius.  \nThat's the only information about temperature which can be proved. \nHowever due to spread situation in Singapore  Thailand,  Malaysia.  it make people believe that when summer comes the virus maybe gone or at least not so aggressive \nMaybe the temperature is a factor,  maybe it's not about temperature but about the ultra violet ray. \nBut for now,  we could only say we don't know."
b'I think you need to inform all that someone associated with your school has is being tested and that once the test results are in you will no more. Keep everything about the person confidential. Always remember a good leader thinks about the whole and getting out ahead of this is probably best.'

b'Stock up on non perishables in the event both of you become quarantined.'
b"Not sure what the CDC or DoS' advice is, particularly for returning travelers from Italy. But really, he needs to self-isolate himself to his own room for 14 days. If he has his own bathing facilities excellent, if not he'll have to disinfect literally everything he touches or uses in the bathroom. But really the advice we're getting here in the UK is you basically need to seal him off; bring food to his door, run his errands. It's a big task, and not one I would do unless there wasn't an alternative for him - like his family home or whatever."
b'Los Angeles and the airport specifically are hubs of transmission. The best thing would probably be for your family to join you in Italy early and wear gloves and masks on the road. One flight instead of three. Flight availability may reduce at any moment too'
b"I would not play russian roulette with my personal/family life or my financials, and it's not going to get any better in the US either by March 13. That is only my personal opinion, but i can see it is a tough decision."
b'International travel from Italy to the US or vice versa has been banned.'
b"I think the deciding factor should be to keep the elderly in laws as safe as possible.  But on the other hand they will still end up catching it no matter what you do.  This RO is really high and America is failing miserably with their responses.  It's like the Americans just don't understand how serious this threatens our elderly.  I'm American and think the CDC,  the president,  and politicians both Democrat and Republican parties all failed equally."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not working for me either.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s not panic; the most likely scenario is some kind of tech issue.'
b"That's probably closer to accurate, yeah."
b"100%, what's currently reported probably isn't even half of the actual number. Remember this is exponential, especially if people don't take the right percautions like self quarantine."
b"Because the data we have now shows that cases start to appear exponentially. So while cases can be low now, they quickly start to stack up as time progresses. \n\nSo little is being done in many population centres, it seems that the prevalent hive mind is that this will all blow over. And if it doesn't then you face the crush of unprepared."
b'The CDC only reports cases they have directly confirmed. Most of the cases mentioned were performed by the individual states.'
b"I believe the CDC doesn't update their numbers over the weekend, and during the week they only post the one daily update at noon. So their current count doesn't include anything reported since noon Friday, until they update today in another ~30 minutes."
b'The John Hopkins site also just stopped reporting numbers... with no explanation about 40 mins ago.'
b"That's just one major event in one country.\n\nEveryday thousands are packing into arenas, night clubs, concert halls, churches, schools, mass transit, movie theatres, lecture halls, just to name a few. \n\nIf it truely has an R0 of 3, how you stopping it."
b'Japan seems to be under reporting and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the Olympics. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of money invested in it.  They should cancel.'

b'If you are offered a refund, I would probably just take it.'
b'I also have flight to Florida to visit 60+ relatives in less than two weeks. Almost all have underlying conditions. Airline announced they would reschedule flights and waive a fee. I am going to see how it pans out this week - if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t leaving soon, I would wait a few more days. Supposedly millions of kits will be available tomorrow and things may change drastically.  Personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the one to introduce the virus to my relatives.'
b'i think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign to stay home, especially if the airline offered a refund. i am in the same position. i had a trip scheduled to visit my dad in arizona (56) and i\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of cancelling too.'
b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s a good cancellation deal I\xe2\x80\x99d do it. And is also make sure your dad has a good supply of stuff and home and doing social distancing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be fine but the risk of carrying it to your dad is the scary part, so make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s ok the best you can from afar.'
b'I live in Ohio (where no one has been diagnosed yet - what a joke how would that be possible ?) and I swear no one cares.  The main response is that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d and I think to myself : I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this virus is not related to the flu virus? Anyways.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to talk to a few members of the family - 70+ year old conservatives - and I thought maybe I was getting through.  Not even being alarmist but just saying hey- maybe not the greatest time to go Walmart twice a week and maybe even rethink church or just don\xe2\x80\x99t shake hands.  One of them told me\nThe other day that they saw \xe2\x80\x9cPence on tv and he said it\xe2\x80\x99s the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d so it was the end of the conversation.  Yesterday they went to Walmart Sunday afternoon totally packed with people - saw a teenager with red face walking around wrapped in a hospital blanket - and told me that *I* would have been so scared.  Ok well at least I tried'
b'If you live in Wuhan/China, yes. Otherwise...probably going to get worse before it gets better.'
b'\nI am glad you asked.\nHere a video .\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg'
b"They dont ban accounts who say it's a hoax or just a flu. Fuck twitter"
b"Because you're spreading misinformation."
b"I think it's unlikely all of those countries will allow entry by April. Or that if they do you still want to go. Sorry, it sounds like a fun trip."
b'Not at all.'
b'Not irrational at all.'
b"No; it makes sense to at least weigh your options and assess the situation.\n\nStuff to consider in your decision include how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b"France is having it real bad right now, and aren't showing any signs of extreme clamping down on the problem.. Not sure you wanna go ahead with the trip. Might be wise actually"
b"They're not getting hit particularly hard.  It's just that we can only compare them to China and South Korea, two countries which used strict, widespread quarantines to slow the spread of the disease.  Italy is now trying (unsuccessfully) to quarantine an affected region; quarantines are not going to work in Iran.\n\nAs the virus spreads, most countries will look more like Italy and Iran than China."
b"They didn't manage to contain early cases as well, so they're several weeks ahead of other countries in virus progression."
b"I assume it's due to their close knit culture.  In Italy it is common to greet one another with a hug and/or light kiss on the cheek.  In Iran their religious culture revolves around praying with one another in close contact, ie mosques."
b"We're not sure; we think somewhere between hours and a few days. Worst-case guesstimate is 9 days, based on behavior of other coronaviruses.\n\nIt could, if an infected person coughed or sneezed on the sweater, and then an uninfected person touched that surface & later touched their eyes/nose/mouth without washing their hands in between."
b"No published research on this yet. \nbut this virus' cousin,  Sars and Mers, depends on different temperature and what object it is, the virus can stay alive on objects  from hours  to days. \nhowever sweater is kind of safe object.  Because there often are static electricity on sweater.  if the amount of virus is not large.  the virus simply just can't escape from your sweater. \nThis is also the theory how face mask can prevent your from virus.  There design to be static electricity on the face mask."
b"There's only a ~10% household transmission rate, so I wouldn't take it as a given, no. Definitely still worth doing what you can to prevent it, even if that's just regular hand washing & covering your mouth & nose with a tissue or elbow when you cough or sneeze.\n\nThat being said, if one of you get it, ideally both of you should self-isolate and stay home."
b"No.  According to China's research,  the total chance to infect a family member who live together is only 15%. \nthat means you still can make some move to avoid that situation. \nOpen windows,  don't sleep and eat together keep distance\xef\xbc\x8c constanly wearing mask for 24 hours\xef\xbc\x8cI think you already know these. \nWhat a I want to addtional remark is the BATHROOM.  quite a number of the patients,  their shit and urine contains huge number of virus, even more than in the mouth.  flash the toilet will splash the virus all over your bathroom. So in a very bad case that situation really happens,  do lot disinfect work in your bathroom."
b'Should probably vote for Bernie Sanders'
b"Most people won't even have to go to the doctor for it, it would only be problematic if you were one of the unlucky ones that had to be hospitalized.  Minimize close contact with other people and practice good hygiene and you should be ok."
b'Occasionally it gets a hug of death when someone features it on a major TV show like BBC or CNN'
b"Gloves don't really do much that hand washing doesn't also do, tbh. Like, if you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your face, it doesn't matter if it's with your bare hand or wearing a glove; you've still cross-contaminated.\n\nYou could use disposable gloves and swap out periodically, I guess, but again, you still need to make the effort to not touch your face.\n\nDefinitely wash your hands before you eat, after using the bathroom, and when you leave work/get home from being out and about, though!"
b"Incubation time is believed to be roughly two weeks, so a month between leaving the cruise and visiting y'all would be plenty of time for her to develop symptoms if she got infected (and if she wasn't asymptomatic, which we think might be a thing). May or may not be enough time to get over it before visiting y'all, though; depends when exactly she gets it and the severity."
b"Your mom is selfish and I'd refuse to allow her in my home as a lesson for that alone."
b'[This?](https://infection2020.com/)'
b"It's not guaranteed that mutations will make the virus stronger. I've actually read that mutations will tend towards decreasing death rate so to as ensure maximum transmission. We also don't yet understand the full long term ramifications of getting this virus. It would be silly to attempt to get it on purpose and may end up being something you regret doing."
b"I'd really ask an actual doctor about that before you even consider it, and... it just really feels like a bad idea to get infected intentionally."
b'It is mostly older folks & folks with underlying conditions, especially ones that impact their lungs, heart, or immune system.'
b"Poll numbers... stock market thats all he cares about... he'll lie and blame others regardless of the outcome."

b'He\'s always been fascinated by numbers, ratings, and statistics. He thinks the higher the number of infected the worse he looks. He forgets that these "numbers" are actual people who are suffering and dying.'
b'China has been testing one million per week for several weeks, so no need to count.\n\nS.Korea has been doing a great job, by testing more than 20 thousands cases by far.\n\naround 1000 cases tested in USA and less than 2000 in Japan'
b'the only compilation list I have seen is from March 2: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/\n\nhopefully that will get updated soon, and it is far from a complete list but it at least gives you an idea. \n\nsome of those numbers come from government updates that are sent out as notices, instead of updating a central page, so they can be quite tedious to find. \n\nthe UK numbers are easy to find because they publish them on a gov site: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\n\ncanada posts the numbers in three different places, they all need to be added up:\n2008 + 553 + 2178 = 4,739 people tested, as of March 6\n\nsources:\nBC- http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus\n\nontario - https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus\n\nrest of canada - https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html'
b"If you're recently diagnosed and on Plaquenil, then it would be best to call your rheumatologist's office and communicate your concerns. Things like your ANA and C-reactive protein levels are easily available to them and they can advise you better than anyone on the internet. Lupus is what happens when your immune system goes haywire and starts attacking your own tissues, the medications are given in an effort to get the inflammatory process under control. Sometimes you have to experiment with different meds to get the right response; this is why the ANA and CRP are so important to monitor, that's how the rheumatologist knows if they're getting it close to right.\n\nDon't just stop your meds without talking with the rheumatologist office. They might actually advise you that it is appropriate to suspend taking them at times when you have an active infection. A phone call to the provider who knows your case is free, and doesn't have negative consequences for you.\n\nGood luck with all of this, it's been 4 years on Cellcept for me."
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Lupus but someone in my family has another autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis) and her doctor told her that she\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to require medical attention should she contract the virus, because of the biologicals she is on. Maybe best to ask your doctor if you can.'
b'Statistically not possible.  The Coronavirus had certain fatality rate for each age group. For President at age 74, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 8%(70-79yrs)\nFor VP it\xe2\x80\x99s 3.6% (60-69yrs) \nPlus all the heavyweight politicians had access to top medical facilities with highest priority, Even if they are infected, chance any of them dying is very slim. (Less than 1%, just like a flu)'
b"There is a chain of succession that goes to, like, fifty people. It won't come to that. Even if you're old, the odds of dying are still quite low. This isn't ebola."
b"If you've been exposed it's two weeks to make sure you don't have it. Working from home if you're able is indefinitely. If summer heat kills this thing it'd end then."
b"Ideally, you work from home as long as you're able, until the outbreak in your area has ended. But especially if you think you've been exposed, you want to stay home two weeks, and if you get *sick*, you want to stay home until you're better and then a bit longer to make sure you don't get worse again."
b'Its up to 2 weeks. You could show symptoms even quicker but 2 weeks is a good quarantine if exposed to find out if itll show.'

b'It may also be that more news and articles are being posted online and in the sub related to the US, because there\xe2\x80\x99s the number of cases and widespread concern are both growing there.'
b'Use RES and setup a filter for the Flair USA and exclude it. That way the sub becomes much more usable again.\n\np.s. this is a credit to the Mods for flairs!'

b"Corona tends to be mainly fever and a dry cough while the flu tends to also have sore throat and runny nose, but you can't distinguish by the symptoms alone."
b'By testing. Impossible otherwise.'
b"I don't think so.  The n95 mask uses electrostatic filters to prevent dirt. The medical device developer in the news reported that using heat, water or alcohol would damage the filter. I've never heard of an ozone generator, but water and heat measures are 100% damaging the filter, and most temporary measures are not good.\n\nkor news: [http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call\\_from=naver\\_news](http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call_from=naver_news)"

b"''phase out just like that?''\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not phasing out, they simply took extreme measures that led to the decrease and some degree of containment."
b"Giving specific medical advice is frowned upon.\n\n\nWithout a test there's really no way to know if you have the nCoV, or one of the many other communicatable viruses, infections common in the world. All you can really do is treat your symptoms, limit your exposure to others like you should for any illness, get rest, maintain fluids and dietary intake. \n\n\nFor the vast overwhelming majority of cases it is mild to moderate symptoms that mirror the flu. I have a personal belief that mental health plays a big part of recovery, if you're worried and anxious you impact your body's ability to fight. \n\n\nIf you're worried keep a diary of your symptoms and any vitals you can monitor."
b'There are reported cases or a risk of community spread of COVID-19 in Antarctica.\n\nIf you travel to Antarctica:\n\nAvoid contact with sick people\nClean your hands often by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%\xe2\x80\x9395% alcohol\nPay attention to your health for 14 days after returning to the US. Stay home and seek medical advice if you get sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing\nAvoid travelling if you are sick\nVisit CDCs webpage for additional information about COVID-19.'
b'Extremely rarely.  Its hard to track exact numbers since its tough to 100% attribute a death to flu, so CDC mostly track pneumonia deaths and deaths that the doctor actually says was flu caused.  So most numbers you see are estimates.  But its around .1% or less for that age group.  Often these people have some sort of underlying undiagnosed issue which made them more susceptible, but you also just get an unlucky person sometimes.  Here are the numbers from 2018-2019.  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html'
b'My sister\xe2\x80\x99s friend passed away a few months ago and she was only 24. No health issues. Unfortunately it happens and doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.'
b"It's really your decision whether or not to go; we can't make that call for you. But stuff to consider in that decision are how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b'You are not overreacting. \nWait till Thursday check the numbers in Spain and the neighbours and decide.'
b'Sad news is fatality in college students are very low. (Which means most of them don\xe2\x80\x99t care) \nBut they do spread out the virus to all parts of states,  their parents should be worried.'
b"Not an expert but here what me and my husband have been doing. Wash hands asap, don't touch anything, dry hands off with paper towel or put towel in laundry right away. Disinfect the knobs with Lysol wipe."
b'He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in the first place.\n\nBut if he do come into your house,  you two are basically bonded together if your two don\xe2\x80\x99t wear masks in house.'
b'I told my parents so they won\xe2\x80\x99t freak out on Coronavirus.  \nBut honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.   \nThe SARS (which is another Coronavirus) disappeared in Late May 2003.  So there are some chances, but nobody knows for sure.'
b"What's true is: nobody knows. People who say this are speculating. This disease is more infectious than the flu and it is currently spreading in southern hemisphere countries that are actively in summer. A more likely speculation is that spread may slow in the summer due to a number of factors (kids out of school, more vitamin d in people's systems, warmer temps mean it lives shorter periods on surfaces), but it will still spread."
b'If it was so why are we seeing spread into the warmer tropical climates. Singapore is aggressively managing but still reporting cases and has temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius everyday.'
b'Many viruses "tend" to prefer cooler temps and may not last as long on surfaces in warmer weather.  This is true of the flu and why you see it drop off in warmer temps.  I suspect no one can give a correct answer for whether this strain will be the same way as it is present in warmer countries right now.  Also, in the summer people are outside more, school is out, there tends to be less transmission.  I suspect we will see a lull over the Summer (in the northern hemisphere) with maybe even a return of it in the Fall.'
b'The majority of recovery come from China, they had the virus under control.  With less than 100 cases per day and decreasing.\n\nBut in other parts of world,  the cases doubles every two or three days.'
b"> She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously\n\nOur problems here are similar to issues across, I imagine, a lot of the Western world. In that we *don't* experience existential challenges or threat regularly, if at all, and so are less inclined to recognise the severity of a situation or threat until it becomes very apparent it is real. Also the experience and outlook of a Londoner, a very young reasonably healthy and affluent City, will be different our towns. I think a lot of people are happier to risk it than sit indoors. \n\n> She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus\n\nAlso sadly think this will likely be because the woman is Asian and either consciously or subconsciously people, in a confined setting, will act differently around her - naturally this is racist. \n\n\nWith regards to testing, the UK Govts advice or treatment approach doesn't change, irrespective of whether you are tested or not, positive or not. Stay at home, self-isolate - the UK government have introduced laws to make it easier to obtain statutory sick pay and employers here are seemingly very comfortable with you working from home or being sick. There's very little the NHS can do for someone with a mild fever and so if you claim to have more severe symptoms they will act more assertively. In the context of limited capacity to carry out tests, this is the right thing to do."
b"I'm from the UK, and it all sounds roughly correct.\n\nYour post makes it sounds like you think the above is a problem.\n\nThe UK (Government & Public) **are** taking it seriously, we just aren't succumbing to hysteria and panic.\n\nIf/when we get to the point where there are tens of thousands of infected, I imagine attitudes will change and people will be more aggressive in distancing/isolating. Until then, we'll keep washing our hands, avoiding touching our faces, and self-isolating if we display symptoms, as advised by the NHS and other experts."
b'Chances are she just has cold/flu.  That is extremely more likely, but there is always a chance she has covid-19.  She should call her doctor and get a recommendation.  That is what the CDC is telling people to do who think they are sick.'
b'Why bother getting tested?  If you (and they) are worried, just take the same precautions as if they have it.   Treat symptoms and self-quarantine.'
b"Same thing in the UK with me. Called 111 and they said it was just a cough. Four days later I call again and they say it's a chest infection \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 hopefully it doesn't progress"
b"Sorry not helpful but I saw a video on Youtube of a man in China volunteering to feed pets in people's homes. They were abandoned due to Wuhan being quarantined so owners outside the city can't return. The video description estimates 30,000 pets abandoned in the city."
b'Sure they are. The government of Iran never tells the true numbers.'
b'Seattle is a prime spot for Cruise Ships. That could have something to do with it.'
b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter. If it had hit a daycare facility or elementary school, there would be no deaths at all. But there probably would have been faster community spread, from those kids to their parents and then beyond.\n\nSource: Am a parent. Have had many cold and flu bugs brought home by our kids over the years.'
b"Not enough info.  If she's going to be in a large group, where in Seattle, etc."
b'Hi! I live in Seattle.\n\nThe likelihood of your mom contracting the virus and passing it on to you and the kids is small, but definitely not zero.  She will probably be fine if she observes the commonly-suggested hygiene practices, e.g., thorough and often hand-washing, covering coughs, keeping a 6-foot distance between herself and others as much as possible, etc.\n\nIs her trip to Seattle absolutely necessary?  Is the small chance of contracting Covid-19 worth it?\n\nHonestly, if she were my mom and the "one day trip" was recreational, I\'d urge her not to go.  Or at least postpone it for a few months.'
b'Seattle is essentially shut down right now. There is talk of bringing in the military. Your mom should not go.'
b'Toucht anything contaminated without washing your hands correctly, or getting closer than 2 meters to an infected person can result in contagion. If you are in an active circulating virus region.'
b"If you keep your distance from other people and don't touch things, it's perfectly fine to go out for a walk."
b"I'm sorry, but asthmatic and diabetic would be two risk factors on the list, I'd push back if I were you. You are younger which is good, but this is a respiratory disease."
b"Until we know how much disruption this causes, it's impossible to say what the country is going to look like 8 months from now."
b"I don't think that's a significant concern with respiratory infections, though I'm not an expert."
b'Probably not; runny nose and sneezing are not symptoms, and coughing is.'
b'1 week of incubation, + about 1-2 weeks of symptoms... Then you recover, if your body can do so. If not, you end up in intensive care.'
b"That's not the problem as far as testing goes. Plenty of people want to be tested, but the tests the CDC produced were fucked up and now they don't have enough functional tests to test everybody who wants one. Even the hospitals who have suspected cases cannot get those patients tested. \n\nThe problem in the US is a lack of test availability. Whether this is due to incompetence or politics is an ongoing debate."
b'I live in Ohio (where no one has been diagnosed yet - what a joke how would that be possible ?) and I swear no one cares.  The main response is that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d and I think to myself : I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this virus is not related to the flu virus? Anyways.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the link unfortunately, but I did read somewhere that most of their cases were under 40 years of age. If I come across that article again, I will post it here.'
b'Coronavirus still hasn\'t beaten "Talking about fantasy football", but is well ahead of "Complaining about the last season of Game of Thrones."'
b"I understand how much the government can enforce some of these things differ by countries, but I think the general population's tendency to stay home and not interact with each other will be similar all around the world. It's really sad if you think about it."
b'Considering how seriously the Koreans have been taking this, it might not be a month for many of us.'
b"I've spent enough time in the US to know how much things differ between Korea and the States. I feel like it's going to be so much tougher for you to deal with this :("
b"The surgical masks won't help at all with protecting you from becoming infected from airborne viruses. It doesn't adequately filter the air you breathe.\n\nThey can help you not infect yourself by preventing you from touching your face and they can reduce the rate at which you infecting others (after you're infected).\n\nThey do very very little to actually help as a preventative measure over all.\n\nThe full-cover air filtering ones might help depending on their grade."
b"> Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.\n\nYes, completely, utterly.  But it's not just fucknut trump and his team of lackeys.  Many states and local governments are fucking things up. Why hasn't the boston marathon been cancelled? Why hasn't the st patricks day parades in boston, Chicago, and ny been cancelled?"
b">  is more concerned about controlling the information and making everything seem like it's fine instead of trying to protect\n\n... which is, 1:1, how China handled it."
b'Authoritarianism governments are all about controlling information. In a democracy that information is used to control the opinions of the constituents. This is to ensure the maintenance of power over time.'
b'Because Republicans are pieces of shit bro where you been'
b"Absolutley, same in Australia. We will reach much higher numbers, I hate to think what it's going to be like in 3 months time."
b"I'd second that regarding the UK. We're going to have major problems. And when increasingly draconian measures come into play the 'I know my rights' brigade will play merry hell.  \n\nThe Cheltenham festival is being held this week. 250,000 people from the global racing world all descending on Gloucestershire and Cheltenham. It's unfathomable how this is being allowed to go ahead...."
b'My guess is that most of the cult members are done being tested, so that probably brought the number of new cases down.'
b"I tried to mentions the little things and small inconveniences that you might encounter that you probably would not expect. I'll try and add more as I think of them."
b"In fairness to SNL - it's a sketch show meant to provide stupid humor to make you laugh.\n\nThere are news outlets that haven't put out anything better than SNL has on this, and their claim to fame isn't 'D\\*ck in a Box'."
b"They won't be laughing 6-8 weeks from now..."
b"Yeah, I saw the episode and really didn't get the impression at all that they were making fun of preparations.  That Sands of Modesto sketch (which I think is the one in question) seemed to be set in a dystopian pandemic future and was just making fun of the absurdities of life then.  I guess some people don't get irony and satire and are just taking the content at face value."
b"I agree firmer approach would've been possible, but compared to other countries, I am happy with how Pres. Moon and the goverment as a whole has responded to the situation. Also, I feel the cult would've found a way to fuck things up no matter how firm our initial response was."
b"They obviously has worse infrastructure to deal with this stuff so I suspect it'll be devastating. At the same time, I don't think we'll be able to get any credible numbers and data about it so we'll never know for sure how bad it was :("
b"It depends on the country, but I live in one of the biggest cities in the world in Seoul and it's not THAT bad. You're taking a risk whenever you step out of the house but you can still buy food, goto reastaurants (if you want to), and do whatever if you want."
b'Thanks, I hope the fact that the US has much lower population density than Korea works to your benefit.'
b"AFAIK, it's a Christianity based church (cult) that thinks its leader Lee Man Hwee is a resurrection of Jesus Christ or something. They're infamous for trying to recruit people off the street with lies, secretively infiltrating other religions to poach out members, secretive about their membership, and most recently, members lying about their attendance in their crowded mass and jump starting Korea's outbreak. You can read more here.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shincheonji_Church_of_Jesus"
b"Yeah, I've got friends in Daegu who's in total lockdown mode. We're not at that level yet, but feels like it could escalate any day."
b"This isn't an abstract kind of recession, either.  You can see the root causes easily.\n\nA recession means a reduction in GDP.  GDP is a measure of how much business is occurring within a country.\n\nWhen people stay in the house and buy only essentials, less business occurs.  Period.  Done.  End of story.  \n\nAdjusting interest rates doesn't get at the root cause of this recession.\n\nNow, in a normal recession, different things are driving the reduction in business.  Take the commercial truck manufacturing business, for instance.  Those commercial trucks last a decade or so, and  they tend to be bought when business are growing, and replaced about ten years later (or at the end of the truck's planned service life, whatever it is).  This tends to make the demand for commercial trucks cyclical, which is rough on everyone. In this case, having lower than expected interest rates can cause a business to adjust it's scheduled fleet upgrade plans a bit, because a lower-than-usual interest rate can save them money and make them more profitable.\n\nThis is not a normal recession, though.  Interest rates have been kept abnormally low for the last few years, because the US federal reserve has faced political pressure to keep the party going.  So, they've used all of their arrows before the enemy showed up.  Plus, their usual tools aren't all that useful for addressing the root cause anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, our usual tools won't blunt the economic blow here.  But, in the USA, the land of no social-safety-net, the economy *is* linked to our individual/family survival. so we have to talk about it in conjunction with the human toll, because they are one and the same for us."
b'Same me last week.'
b"I have both re-read The Stand and re-watched Contagion in the past day or so (well, I've been reading The Stand for a few weeks now...it's a long ass book...almost to the end). \n\nI loved to self-trigger myself."
b"Me too! It's oddly therapeutic.  Watching this excellent movie takes all the shapeless anxiety buzzing around in my head and gives it a narrative structure and somewhere to land.  I feel better after I watched it last night."
b"I 100% agree with you! \n\n\nThis is me in everyday life tbh. I'm completely no stress when it comes to everything (on a side note, I don't even have an interest in learning anything about history, as it's already happened & I can't do anything about it \xf0\x9f\x98\x82)\n\n\nMy SO is pretty worried at the potential of this virus so I'm 100% on board with taking precautions - we're washing our hands more regularly (although we're pretty hygeic like that anyway), we're taking steps to avoid large groups where possible, we're using disinfectant sprays more often & we have equipped our kids with their own hand sanitizer & info on not sharing school supplies, not touching their faces, etc.\n\n\nI am not worried personally, if it comes we'll deal with it - but I'd never judge someone whose worried or play this thing down."
b'I think they did (in an esoteric sense). The risk to individual Americans may be low, but the systemic risk is high. The stock market is focused on systemic risks, not individual risks. This is precisely why politic talk to "soothe" the masses has done nothing to curb the market free fall. The system has every reason to panic even if individuals don\'t.'
b'Actually the market likely did. The market is concerned due to a whole host of factors. Supply chain issues, economic effects of people social distancing, cancellations of events, major economic hits to travel industry etc.'
b"Government is actually doing what they can. Mistakes were made in past years, but there's no time for complaining."
b"like they do delivery and pickup, but don't know which for about 14 days."
b'Thanks, that was what I was thinking. A friend suggested it might be a scam which had my head spinning in another direction.\n\nI will wait to hear from the travel agent.  We have flown to Ireland via LAX before so not a huge deal, although visas would need to be obtained.  \n\nWe are leaning towards cancellation at this stage. We dont particularly want to get trapped in Europe, and really dont want to expose our loved ones (specifically my elderly MIL) to anything we collect on the way.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s really crazy right?? I went to a follow up doctor appointment today and the doctor shook my hand. WTF.'
b'Hamsters can be used as toilet paper, then washed and used again.'
b'I think its a German phrase for when people go and "panic shop" like a hamster filling its check pouches with seeds'
b'In german we say "Hamsterk\xc3\xa4ufe" which basically means, that people empty out supermarkets and stock up an unnecessary amount of food at home.'
b"I think it's the same as stockpiling."
b'Toilet paper is sold out everywhere for example'
b'This. 70% ethanol is best. 100% drys out too quickly'
b'FWIW China has not reported any deaths under the age of 10, nor has the rest of the world.'
b'I wanted to say something along those lines, but I know my wife would chew me out for it.\n\nIt was so incredibly surreal.'
b'Has the UK tested previous flu tests against covid-19?\n\nFinland did that, and I just wonder if any other country has done so.'
b"Thank you. I don't know where you are, but I hope the whole world gets to be rid of this virus soon."
b'I certainly agree it would be difficult to implement.   But on 9/11, they managed to ground 4,000 aircraft in a matter of hours on a split-second decision.  That seemed like it would have been nearly impossible to implement, but they made it happen.'

b"*waves in African\n\nSouth Africa has 4 cases so far, all coming from Italy, but there a report this morning of a suspected case where the person never left SA so we'll see"
b'No panic, just very concerned. Given the recent news, not reporting numbers would seen like a perfect action to take to stop people from reacting. \n\nThere a lot of politicians and others with vested interest to keep constituents in the dark for as long as possible. People worried about poll numbers and the economy first, and human lives second are in charge in a lot of places right now.'
b'I believe they are including state reports, actually, but they only update at noon on weekdays, so their count lags behind.'
b'Surely the risk alone should be enough. Hopefully they make the smart decision'
b"Yeah airlines don't offer refunds unless the situation is dire. I'd take the refund"
b'You hit it right on the head with not wanting to be the one to introduce the virus to anyone; relatives, especially. I rarely follow the news and this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on Reddit in months so I had no idea this was becoming an epidemic. I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be keeping up with this subreddit now. Thanks for the response!'
b'I just checked out that useful interactive map someone made and posted to this subreddit. Turns out there\xe2\x80\x99s a confirmed case in Manatee Cty. where my dad lives. No doubt about it \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the refund and begging him to stay indoors.'
b'Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly worried about being a carrier and possibly infecting my dad and other people. Just can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure when a case will show up by chance in my airport. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the cancellation.'
b'I agree, I think the US in particular is in for a rough ride. But if Wuhan is already coming good, that\'s gotta be a good sign right? There\'s been a few deaths, and I know this might come off as heartless, but nowhere near the apocalyptic scenario I\'ve been coming to expect. Or did China just nip it early and the rest of the world is in a "calm before the storm" phase?'
b'Perfect! Thank you!'
b'Okay thanks for the info.'
b'34 days after returning form the cruise is more than enough to cover incubation time for the virus, your response would be irrational.'
b'Do you have a source on that?  I have never seen any breakdown of hospitalization rate by age.'
b'The UK has tested 23,513 people.'
b'do you have a source for china testing 1m/week? (not questioning, im just interested)'
b'very bad, but atleast i\xe2\x80\x99m back in standard time so i\xe2\x80\x99m happy'
b"Just like I had said in my comment above, if you are worried, just treat it as if you were infected.   Self-quarantine.   Treat the symptoms.  There is no cure.   If you are relatively healthy, you'll get over it like any other case of the flu."
b"Yea :( - I'm only 42 so hopefully I'll survive if it finds me.  And hopefully the virus itself doesn't do more damage than what is known so far (or potential for relapse/chronic issues).  \n\nI really appreciate what you wrote.  I read it aloud to my wife who thinks I'm being overly panicked about this (as many Americans do about other Americans who are paying attention).   \n\nStay well!"
b"Sure, but with this virus there is evidence that you are contagious before showing symptoms. \n\nSo better to assume you are infected and act accordingly if it's reasonable.\n\nThat might mean having a mask handy but not wearing it all the time; but if you already have a supply of masks there would be little reason not to wear one."
b"There's also a case to be made that surgical masks will help you from getting milder illnesses which would weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to contracting more serious illnesses."
b'Except they actually did things while making out everything is fine.   It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d while testing millions of people, shutting down cities etc and another thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d and force everyone to _act_ like everything is fine.    It\xe2\x80\x99s like the crew on the titanic refusing to lower lifeboats and telling everyone to go back to bed.'
b'Also in Australia they tell us no need for everyone to wear a mask.'
b"You'd have to be fucking mental to attend anything right now. If the govt. et al won't shut things down we need to just opt-out ourselves asap."
b"There's 317,000 church members and they're testing 10,000 people per day over there.  You might be right about that.  In which case, the drop in new cases wouldn't necessarily be reflective of the virus situation in the country at large."
b'I saw that and really appreciated it. We keep seeing official guidelines and general recommendations, but I suspect living in an area with an ongoing quarantine effort or just more social distancing affects so many little parts of everyday life.\n\nThere are so many parts of society, jobs, and routine activities that this will likely be disrupted for some time.\n\nIt must feel surreal, and maybe only more so as you get used to it.'
b'Thanks for this aspect, and everything else you\xe2\x80\x99re doing for us all. \n\nBecause of the little details I\xe2\x80\x99m now wondering what preparations I might do. Like resupplying kids craft supplies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to; and other preparations that I take so that we survive school  holidays. (New card games and board games; sports equipment; frozen meals for me coz I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted having a kid here 24hr a day;  etc.)\n\nI only just survived the Christmas holidays - I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to be unexpectedly struck down by school closures!'
b'[deleted]'
b'In case others are wondering how something like contact details are "mixed up".  It actually happens to me all the time.\n\nI travel frequently for work, as per company policy I have to book through our corporate travel agents, and they only accept company email addresses.  I\'m a member of a couple of Frequent Flyer programs. To take advantage of the mileage accruals, I ask the travel agency to indicate my frequent flyer number.  When they do that, the travel booking appears in my personal airline login.  Once the link is made, the airlines will notify me (via my personal email address and registered phone number) directly of any changes, seat selections, meal choices, and early check-in communications.  In fact I get more comms from airlines about my upcoming travel than I do from the travel agents.'
b'Seems better than the three seashell method.'
b"Haha, gotcha. In the US a hamster is a small rodent, and I thought Germans were 'stocking up' on rodents at the supermarket for some reason."
b"the reason 70% is used more widely than 100% is that water content helps penetrate cell membranes and walls. There is no need to use 100% ethanol, it's not more effective than 70%. \n\nsource: years of research"
b'I mean, that was a specific, already highly-regulated industry, not literally everyone & everything. Not a great comparison.'
b'The worst -ism'
b'First of all: will there be flights to get there?\n\nSecondly: will there be enough officials and volunteers?\n\nThird: will people not from Japan want to take the risk to travel there and maybe get stuck in quarantine.'
b'Good choice! I wish you and your family well.'
b'China had an extremely aggressive response, which most of the rest of the world will not be able/willing to match.'
b"The problem is China can completely control their citizens so even though the botched the beginning they could stop everything in key places. Western governments won't have it so easy"
b'Yes, https://www.biocentury.com/article/304545/who-china-makes-and-deploys-1-6-million-covid-19-tests-week-the-u-s-is-just-starting-to-ramp-up-capacity\n\nactually WHO said China now test up to 1.6 million cases per week, more than I mentioned above.\n\nActually, if you are from Japan, Korea, Iran, Italy, you will be tested upon arrival airports in some cities in China for free, and receive the results no later than two days, since you are not suspect case, and if you have fever, your result will be returned within hours'
b'It was light out till 6:30 today! So happy to see that. I hope this is the last time we have to change our clocks in BC.'
b"The difficulty with that is most people can't afford to not work for 2 weeks and unless it's recommended by a medical professional that you self quarantine it'll be difficult to get sick pay."
b'I imagine the main concern for you guys is people without health insurance will not want to present themselves for treatment for fear of ridiculous costs. Prob the only 1st world country where people have to prioritse money over health. Hopefully your govt provides funding in some way.'
b"It's more than just us surviving though, the big concern is if we catch it then pass it onto other people who have much worse chances of survival."
b"To be fair, they are correct. Most people have no idea how to properly use masks, to the degree where random Europeans or Americans suddenly deciding to use masks will probably **increase** their odds of getting infected. There's a lot of issues regarding to how to equip/unequip masks (i.e. you have a high chance of infecting yourself if you touch the front parts of a long-worn mask), the fact that most masks aren't meant to be used more than a few hours, and will end up accumulating bacteria / infectious particles when used for days, etc etc etc.\n\nConversely, the people who should be using masks are those already infected, because here the primary purpose is to reduce the amount of infectious droplets leaving their mouse/nose. (Technically, they could even wear the same mask for multiple days, because anything they use and wear will be contaminated anyways...)\n\nSo, if the government flat-out issues statements of 'don't rush and buy all the masks and start spamming their use', that's actually legitimate (if not very explanatory) advice."
b"Not saying you're wrong, but as of right now those issues are all out of my control. I hope the amazing people trying hard to come up with the cure/vaccine succeed sooner than later, and everyone around me takes basic precautions like washing hands and wearing masks. But for me and my family, we're just trying to survive this mess without contacting the virus and not go out of our mind from not being able to live like we used to."
b'Lol calm down dude. Korea is handling this exceptionally well, their rate of new cases is actually declining. The same can be said of China, which is starting to re-open schools. Source: https://twitter.com/business/status/1236877340615081984'
b'Be well John Spartan.'
b'a Hamster is the small rodent in german as well. Hamesterk\xc3\xa4ufe means, that people a stocking up like a hamster, because hamster store their food in their cheeks'
b'that would be amazing'
b'Yeah, but as you stated, the main benefit of wearing a mask is that people that are infected spread fewer infectious germs. So it makes absolutely sense for everyone to wear one (assuming enough are available), since nobody knows if they are infected and might be spreading corona'
b"Very cute expression. I love it.\n\nAlso very relieved to hear Germans don't eat hamsters. :)"

b"As bad as the Chinese govie messed up at least they are making an effort to help. They would be within the right to say fuck you pay us. So I am in no way a Chinese govie cheerleader but if you don't give props where props(carrot) are due then the stick you get later has no real meaning.\n\nWe should be encouraging China by not always looking down our noses and treating the people with respect. I was deeply saddened to hear Asian Americans (I assume from all countries as my fellow American is on average pretty racist/ ignorant apparently) that they were buying guns for protection from other Americans due to Covid-19 attacks.(I didn't hear of any attacks but the one guy that got beat up) \n\nNot trying to veer into politics so forgive me if I crossed that line but we need to be encouraging of all countries to be honest about their responses to this so that we can learn. The good the bad and the ugly. 1918 SF had a lot of things we can draw from but it was a different world then and almost impossible to think of all the ways those differences affect(effect?) Current global economy, goods transfer both physical and digital(since wfh is being ramped up) even education and resource allocation. Hell even the population density/locations have changed in big ways in some cases. Say Detroit vs Seattle (assuming that back in the day Seattle was not quite so packed I'm only mid 30's so I don't really remember very far). This data matters and yeah we got shit data to start but if I remember correctly the Chinese people are very proud and it shows in the govie. Japan is much the same. Here in America we are shocked at Japanese officials apologizing for late trains..Money is a big motivator but it's not the only one so let's capitalize on the opportunity to improve the world for everyone. \n\nNo I don't expect China to stop the awful stuff but how much can we really bad mouth them with the shit American govie does to not only our own but others.....our track record isn't clear and I think we should clean our own house while we are busy pointing fingers elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear this isn't a demo vs repub thing or a pro/anti (fill-in the blank president) this is learning to look past country flaws and see humans as humans and not enemies."

b'Globalisation more or less means embracing global trade. Inevitably, companies will purchase labour as cheaply as they can get it and people will work for those companies if it provides a better life than they had before.'
b'You are absolutely correct but at the same time you completely miss the big picture. \n\n1. Poor people escape malnutrition and huger into  cities. They live in slums and scavenge landfills if nothing else.  China for example has almost eradicated hunger  but it still exists in some places in countryside. \n2. People in sweatshops are one step above people in absolute poverty in  countryside, streets and landfills.  \n3. Poor people in developed countries lose their jobs to people in developing countries. \n4. Net effect is better living standards overall even for the poor, but poor are always doomed to worse conditions in everywhere. \n\nGlobalization is net benefit for the humanity and it works trough magic of comparative advantage.  The adverse effects of globalization come from governments not reducing inequality within their countries or having global standards that mitigate  adverse effects.'
b"Ironically I think the end result of globalization, after it envelopes more and more facets of everyone's lives over time, is the eradication of sweat shops and realization of workers' rights for all. It's just a mud and blood entrenched trail to get there. It's inevitable."
b"I'd love to see how many Americans can afford $40 t-shirts produced in the USA. I'm also pretty sure most Americans *don't want* the jobs that have been sent to other countries. 14 hour shifts at insanely demanding and monotonous manufacturing jobs that pay peanuts? The only people that live here who want those jobs are immigrants that anti-globalists want to get rid of. Can you imagine how much all of this technology we're addicted to would cost at US wages?\n\nPoorer countries absolutely need better labor standards, and US companies that are outsourcing should be more picky with their suppliers and use leverage to ensure they don't end up with factories in their supply chain with suicide nets or textile plants that are on the verge of collapse. That said, we aren't getting away from globalism unless we resign ourselves to a much lower quality of life. 95% of Americans couldn't afford a smartphone if it was produced in the US."
b"This. I'm still cynical somewhat about the CCP but not every Chinese person tows the official line. Stuff like this serves a reminder that each chinese is a person before a communist, and that no matter what you think of a government, the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI think this is a beautiful act from a company and can further strengthen relations in the future once this is done by. How we treat our neighbours, especially when it's under control within our own borders, may play a big part in how people see us in the future"
b"Hey I'm good with the quarantine urgency, just not how they could have snipped this in the bud at the start but instead went and silenced people. Then again western is shaping up to not really do much better, just fail differently."
b'The whole reason we are in this mess is because Chinese government ignored the warnings of the doctors in wuhan who were warning them that it will be bad, for like two months... and not only ignoring them but not allowing them to speak to media etc. to say oh maybe you should wash your hands more and not go outside as much.'
b"Well both respect and shame them on how they've handled it. They did build hospitals and were effective. However they silenced it at the start, witch might have lead to a bigger problem than if they just admitted at the start"

b"Makes sense if you think it's going to spread everywhere soon. Prevents other countries from buying up your stock and leaving your own country with less. Of course it has all sorts of secondary effects and it'll probably end up in some EU court in a few years after this all blows over."
b'Credit to the Japanese. It\'s one of the only things I find heart-warming about this terrible disaster. Someone needs to repost it to r/HumansBeingBros .\n\nNow, Chinese people followed this fashion and donated masks to other countries with quotes from their own classic literature. \n\nMy favorite ones are: to Daegu, Korea: "the roads cannot estrange people, there\'s no border between human beings", by Choe Chiwon, a Korean scholar who studied in China during the 9th century; to Iran: "The children of Adam are the members of each other, who are in their creation from the same essence. When day and age hurt one of these members, other members will be left (with) no serenity. If you are unsympathetic to the misery of others, it is not right that they should call you a human being", a famous quote from Saadi.'
b"I'm told that Chinese who live in Japan made this idea from the beginning. But I don't have strong resource to proof this point, just wanna say what you heard might not be the truth. Anyway, the result is people in Italy who need masks now have more supplies."

b'This is all true but you have to remember some people don\xe2\x80\x99t care if there is more suffering in China and would welcome it.'
b"You must have taken an economics course at some point or ran into some libertarian ideology and didn't look to closely. \n\nYou point to the positive and ignore the negative. You see people in poor countries get a little richer and ignore people in rich countries getting poorer. You believe in a linear direction for all countries; only ever better and richer. But that is not the world we live in. If things were getting better [deaths of despair](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html) would not be a thing. The formerly rich fall further down than the formerly poor rise up. This is a necessary fact, otherwise the job would not be outsourced in the first place.\n\nYou also put too much stock into the comparative advantage argument. This argument assumes that all competition is only between people and not between people and machines, it assumes that there are always needs to be fulfilled, and it assumes that people will always be able to make enough money to cover their basic needs allowing for, you know, survival. None of these assumptions hold in the real world.\n\nIn the real world a machine would compete with the human, the value of labor can drop below what the human needs for survival and another death of despair would happen. The machine will only get better over time."
b"You are more optimistic than me. So far what I see is the power of unions being undermined and a race to the bottom for work conditions. And I don't believe in the 'it needs to get worse before it gets better' mantra.\n\nLet's agree to disagree."
b'> , the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI can understand paying less attention to your government when your living situation as a citizen is improving so quickly that your income doubles every few years. While you still remember living in poverty when you where young. You just want them to keep doing what they are doing.\n\nThis certainly doesnt mean that the international community should let the Chinese Government get away with their crimes though.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s your excuse in the West to run around like headless rats?'
b'Exactly - had they been transparent about what was going on, and addressed doctors concerns instead of silencing and arresting them, maybe they wouldn\'t have needed such draconian measures afterward to try to combat the virus.\n\nWith total control of information going in or out, though, I would be very reluctant to "respect" anything they\'ve done there.  I don\'t think the US is making the right moves re: quarantine, but I don\'t think throwing anyone who so much as looks sick into the back of a white van to be "quarantined" against their will is any better.'
b"Isn't everyone who is not from Switzerland?"
b"Not sure if you're sarcastic or not."

b"The quote that went along with the donations from Japan to China was actually used more than a thousand years ago during Chinese Tang Dynasty when, for the sake of communicating the knowledge of Buddha, Japanese authority made and sent thousands of Buddha gowns to Chinese monks, and all the gowns were embroidered with kanji \xe5\xb1\xb1\xe5\xb7\x9d\xe5\xbc\x82\xe5\x9f\x9f \xe9\xa3\x8e\xe9\x9b\xa8\xe5\x90\x8c\xe5\xa4\xa9, which roughly means mountains and rivers on different lands, wind and rain under the same sky.

You can basically get the specs of a \xc2\xa3500-\xc2\xa3600 phone (by one of the mainstream manufacturers) for something like \xc2\xa3200-\xc2\xa3300 with no real downsides. One of the things about them is that they all have very impressive cameras on them often similar to the expensive flagship phones.\n\nSome people complain that the phones all have built in ads and bloatware but I personally don't get any ads with the default Chinese MIUI firmware.

b"The value of labor was always going to drop as soon as we got machines. Labor isn't as valuable an asset as it was 50 years ago, that's why it's easier to ship it off to third world countries where it is a bit more valued. That's why higher education and training is important, clinging to dying industries and denigrating globalization is meaningless."
b'My take: The end of "globalization" (as defined 3 comments above) will happen when automation takes over - when AI and machinery become more advanced and cost-efficient than a human laborer. \n\nBut it\'s gonna come with its own set of issues, looking at the Mouse Utopia experiment.'
b"I agree with you wholeheartedly.  This incentivizes poor conditions for workers.  You're going to let unions demand better conditions?  OK, say goodbye to your industry.

b'>I assume the difference between Ecclesiastical Latin and Classical Latin lies in things like "v" being pronounced "v" or "w" and such?\n\nIt\'s a bit more than that. Ecclesiastical Latin follows Italian pronunciation, so things like ce/ci become che/chi, like when you hear him say \'\'pace\'\' as \'\'pache\'\'. He also said \'\'ma**g**ister\'\' as in \'\'jacket\'\'. Ecclesiastical Latin is an artificial pronunciation created by the church.   \n\n\nIn Classical Latin c is always /k/, therefore \'\'pace\'\' would be pronounced \'\'pake\'\', and the g is always a hard /g/ as in \'\'ghost\'\', therefore, magister would be pronounced differently. You also have a 3rd pronunciation called scientific Latin, which is 99% Classical except for the V, which is pronounced just like in Ecclesiastical to differentiate it from the vowel U.  \n\n\nPersonally, I dislike Ecclesiastical Latin as it sounds horrible to pronounce Latin like that.'

I\'ve been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria...there is little I haven\'t been exposed to in my profession. And with notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared.\n\nI am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.\n\nWhat I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they " probably don\'t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know..." and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess.\n\nI am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you even  \nimagine?\n\nI\'m scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession.\n\nBut mostly, I\'m scared about what message we are telling our kids when faced with a threat. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.\n\nCovid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it. Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and "fight for yourself above all else" attitude could prove disastrous.\n\nI implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let\'s meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.\n\nFacts not fear. Clean hands. Open hearts.  \nOur children will thank us for it.'

b'Pandemic has no official definition, and each government agency can define it how that like.\n\nThe term was even retired a few years ago and replaced, i forget the replacement name.\n\nIf CNN wants to use the term pandemic it can. I will just keep calling it \xe2\x80\x9cbatshitcrazydemic\xe2\x80\x9d.'

b"China is on the road to recovery, and the USA hardly has any cases. It's over give it up guys. All these doom and gloom people just want the world to end. A virus that causes 2% death. The regular flu is far more dangerous. There is a flu shot for that. Get your flu shot everyone and wash your hands."
b"Except it's not a Pandemic... A quick google search verifies that this is not the case.   \n\n\nAs defined, a Pandemic is a disease prevalent over a whole country or the world. Prevalent meaning widespread.  \n\n\nSo, a disease that is widespread over an entire country, or all over the world. Yes, there are clusters of cases in different countries, but it is far from being wide spread over the entire countries, and definitely not widespread over the entire world.  \n\n\nIs Cancer a Pandemic?

b'Who cannot use the term "pandemic" because there is no definition in this sense in their procedures. They are now referring to the event as "a major global emergency". Basically, it\'s just semantics.\n\nRegarding CNN... They are right to use the layman term "pandemic" but let\'s not kid ourselves: they DO have ulterior motives. The administration\'s response was abysmal, so underlining the severity of the situation and posting it against the ineptitude of the authorities is a very direct way of injuring the GOP. Don\'t get me wrong, the essence is right in what CNN is doing and reporting, but I have a reasonable doubt that their approach would have been similar had the US had a Democratic administration.'

b'Please avoid off-topic political discussions.\n\nOur policy on political posts is as follows:\n\nThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned.'

b'According to stats around 10% of Covid patients need intensive care, mostly because they need machines to breathe/keep them alive. A friend of mine works in a medium sized hospital. She stated they had oxygen at every hospital bed, but only around 30 respiratory support machines. And just 4 of those machines that mix oxygen into your blood directly if your lungs are shutting down completely.  She is psychiatrist, but they are getting crash courses to care for patients with SARS, freeing beds, postponing all non urgent treatments and are preparing the psychiatric ward for Corona patients.\n\nShe said, they have no covid cases yet, but when those 30 ICU beds are full, they will have to decide who lives and who will slowly suffocate to death. She is really scared and stressed. There are no covid deaths in Germany yet, but if the ICUs are full, death toll will ramp up just like in northern Italy. \n\nAnd that\'s the main reason progress must be slowed. We only have a limited number of hospitals, doctors, nurses and ICUs.\n\nEdit: The psych ward beds are no hospital beds and don\'t have oxygen of course. But they would be in charge for non-compliant "less cooperative" infected patients (drug them and restrain) and for terminally ill patients / palliative care for patients sorted out due to triage. "We are not allowed to kill patients. I mean, you put your dog to sleep if he is beyond recovery to do him a last favour, but we aren\'t allowed to do that. People with SARS and without ventilation will slowly suffocate to death. I have been told to think about a way to medicate them to ease their suffering and panic, but my medication can not be the cause of their death. By god, if it was me I would tell them to OD me morphines, but no, I have to suffocate myself to death, like drowning in slow motion. Because law...I can\'t be your cause of death. Nature has to be. Your death has to be aaaaall natural, no added chemicals..."\n\nShe\'s getting really cynical. I have never seen her like that. She is venting to me. I am scared shirtless and can\'t sleep. But for her it has to be ten times worse so I listen.'

b"Yeah, this is r/coronavirus everyone here is so embroiled in fear that they're stock piling toilet paper because they think that 1.5 billion people in China will stop manufacturing. There's a psychological term for this, damn I wish I remembered it. It's basically trying to convert an adult who has been of one religion their entire life, the belief is so engrained in their brain that no fact, evidence or opinion will sway them, even if a different god came to earth and preformed miracles they still wouldn't convert. They believe it's out of control and are being lied to so the WHO becomes the enemy, this is how terrorist are made people! It's the same brain function.... Why am I explaining this to sheep, they'll never get, it's not psychologically possible. r/science is a much better place to discuss COVID-19."
b"I don't know why you're getting down voted. You've summed it up so well but I guess people don't want to listen to reason."
b"According to *your number*, covid-19 is 20x deadlier than the flu, at 0.1% mortality rate.  The flu does not land 10-20% of infected in the hospital for weeks, either.  The US has over 550 cases, and the only people getting tested are those with heavy symptoms and travel history.  *Nurses on the front line* can't get tested.  So if 80% of infected are too mild to get tested, that means about 2750 people are actually infected, and spreading.\n\nRational thinkers aren't worried about mass graves--we're looking at health care and services getting overwhelmed."
b'its about projection of infection manifestition as well.\nit will not stay at the current level, the number of infected will increase.\n\nI do not think china or italy are stupid or over reacting.'

b'Do you know what respiratory means? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a hint: it has to do with a fucking important organ system you fucking idiot'
b"I'm not worried much for myself. I'm young and relatively healthy. I'll almost certainly be fine even if I get it. But it can and has been deadly for older populations and those with weaker immune systems (think cancer patients undergoing chemo and HIV positive patients). And it could be real bad for those that already have lung issues such as COPD. \n\nBut it's also a novel form of respiratory virus. We don't know everything about it and it is spreading and spreading fast. We don't need to outright panic, but we need to take it seriously - even if you aren't part of the most susceptible populations you should be taking precautions to protect yourself so that you don't pass it on to them."
b"It's hilarious that the WHO still hasn't declared it a pandemic. At this point they shouldn't even bother; it'll only draw attention to the fact that they missed the boat by a country mile."
b'"We have traced the infection chain all the way back to Wuhan, so no pandemic yet"\n\n/- WHO, as the last person on the planet gets infected.'
b'And the CDC.'
b'I think something everyone needs to learn is how to know the difference between taking something seriously and going into a panic. If people are told to take something seriously, too many jump to "stop trying to scare me and make me panic!" That\'s not always the goal.'
b"Wait until the virus starts popping up in nearby cities and counties, then people are going to really listen. I've seen the sentiment at my workplace, live in Oregon, go from it's fine it's less than a cold just cover up and wash hands, to I'm only going out as needed.

b"We don't rank at the top of the lists because of healthcare availability is low. The quality of our doctors is among the world's best, that's why many good doctors from other countries come to practice in the US. Where we fail is getting access to care to the general public."

b'Pandemic Phase 6: Community-level outbreaks are in at least one additional country in a different WHO region from phase 5. A global pandemic is under way.'
b'To add in, if the curve goes above the capacity line, a lot more people start dying. The longer the curve is above the capacity line, the more people die. \n\nA simple scenario is that hospitals run out of spare ventilators. People who could be saved with this support (including people who are sick for other reasons) would die in that case.\n\n(I think New York State has around 5,000 ventilators in regular use, with around 1,500 in storage for emergencies. Going by 20% of people getting sick needing vents, all that spare capacity gets eaten up if less than 10,000 people get sick at once.)'
b'I hate that this is the image that\'s going around. Hubei\'s healthcare system was overwhelmed at less than 1% of cases, doing a bit of simple math reveals that every other healthcare system in the world gets overwhelmed somewhere between 0.1% and 1% cases. So if you\'re going to draw this graph, draw it with the peak 20 - 50x higher and the "best case" scenario being the healthcare system overwhelmed for a full year.\n\nThe only solution is to bend the R0 curve down severely so at most 1% of your population gets infected. The Chinese themselves said every 5 days of inaction, your situation gets 3x worse. You can say "China lies" all you want but if you\'re not even willing to accept the truthful stuff coming out of China, what use is there even to China lying?'
b'We need people like her speaking out to those in charge both politically and those that run medical facilities, as well as to the general public. \n\nIt might be too late, but if only we could start building emergency facilities as well as getting American factories to ramp up creation of ventilators and things for repertory health!'

b"WHO states it has to reach all 7 continents for definition of pandemic. \n\nUntil it reaches Antarctica it won't ever be."
b"Exactly. There's a huge gap between being well informed and making precautions, and sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is okay. Calling it a pandemic is not 'alarmist'. Informing people about the virus and its effects around the world is not 'alarmist'. But too many people would rather just plug their ears."
b'Yes. I work as a truck loader and we deal with electronic car antennas that come from Vietnam. There are no confirmed cases here, but there are in Vietnam. So I asked if we could have a meeting to talk about this outbreak and how we should take extra precautions.\n\nImmediately I was declined because it\'s "all over the news" and " everyone already knows" and "to just wash your hands" and "no need to cause panic".\n\nI hate to say it, but with how easily people turn a blind eye to such a global incident, some are just begging for trouble.'

b"My more conspiracy minded acquaintances claim the whole thing is made up. It's just a bad cold being turned into something more so the government can seize power, companies can sell the eventual vaccine, rich people can make money using it to manipulate the stock market, and/or the Left is using it to steal the election from Trump. \n\n(Note these are not all conservatives. Liberal conspiracists tend to see it as stock market manipulation while the conservative ones see it as a political attack)."
b"People need to take it seriously but not panic. If you get it, wear a mask to prevent it from spreading airborn(if possible, not fully caught up on it) and have consistent hand washing. It's not the worst thing that could hit but it's definitely not a good thing or something minor."
b"> Trump's denial of it being a pandemic\n\nTrump's not the one denying that it's a pandemic - the CDC/WHO are. Trump is saying it's just a cold and that like a miracle, it'll disappear before April."

b"The pandemic bonds have nothing to do with what the WHO calls it. There are specific criteria based on spread and deaths in countries.

b"I don't understand your criticism. This conveys the current strategy to prevent the current healthcare system being overwhelmed. The goal is slow the rate of case build up. \n\nIs your point that there is no hope and that everything is doom and gloom?"
b'Well, yes, they are a company based in the US. But you are aware that they report on global news? And this is a global pandemic? I think you should look up the definition of the word pandemic.'
b"Thank you. People seem to think that there's about 2 *million* on earth. A few thousand is the smallest drop in the bucket imaginable"
b'I think you e confused yourself. He is saying cnn making it a pandemic will make it less credible. I am saying that his satire post was perfectly impersonating someone who solely watches Fox News and Sean Hannity.\n\nThe trump voter that already thinks Cnn fakenews will see this as an attempt at \xe2\x80\x9cdems trying to cause coronavirus fear\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the accurate classification that it is. \n\nAka his original comment is valid: the more people believe it\xe2\x80\x99s just fear mongering dems, whether what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is true or false, the less serious a large portion of the population will treat the virus.'

b'>You ever had the common cold? A cough? That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what this is.\n\nYou should really read the reports of some infected.\n\nThere was a "mild" case report from Italy, he wrote about feeling like drowning for over a week.

b'10-20% of people need hospitalization. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x99s as mild as the common cold.'
b'If you look at the conditions needed for those bonds to go into effect, it has nothing to do with the declaration. Its all about confirmed cases and spread (which is probably why governments are trying to not test).'
b'So basically the purpose of the bond was pointless because of greed'
b"So a few things.\n\n1) wasn't aware of this, kind of fucking morbid.\n\n2) this quote has *not* aged well;\n\n>World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim\xc2\xa0said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are **moving away from** *the cycle of panic and neglect that has characterized so much of our approach to pandemics.* We are leveraging our capital market expertise, our deep understanding of the health sector, our experience overcoming development challenges, and our strong relationships with donors and the insurance industry to serve the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest people. This creates an entirely new market for pandemic risk insurance. Drawing on lessons from the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, the Facility will help improve health security for everyone. I especially want to thank the World Health Organization and the governments of Japan and Germany for their support in launching this new mechanism.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'This is inaccurate. The terms of the bond are not dependent upon any official declaration of pandemic.

b'Are the CDC and WHO truly independent?\n\nSerious question.'
b"He's probably mixing a few things he's heard. There are two strains of coronavirus that are endemic and cause seasonal colds. And for most people COVID-19 will just be a mild or moderate chest cold. \n\nColds, including coronavirus ones, do seem to be seasonal so it may well die down this summer -- but then reappear in the Fall. It also might not be seasonal, we won't know until this summer. \n\nIf it is seasonal that gives us a chance to stop it. Widespread testing and isolation of people who might catch it during the summer could stop it. But I suspect it has spread to countries that can't or won't do that and we'll get the strain again from somewhere like India or Nigeria or South Africa. Or even the US."

b'I would disagree with this statement. It\'s all general stuff without any sources. I\'m from Canada. I had a heart attack a couple of years ago. I went into emergency and in less than 3 hours after entering the hospital, I was waking up from a angioplasty. They had put in a stent in one my arteries. My heart suffered at most 5% effectiveness. It cost me nothing. The only paper I had to sign was a standard liability form.\n\nThe hospital where they performed on me has a world leading cardiology Dept. They have invented procedures used by cardiologist all over the world. \n\nI got great quality (10 out of 10) and no extra cost to me. \n\nAccess for non life threatening procedures can be improved upon for sure in Canada.  It better or worse depending on what you need and where you are. \n\nIn the case of COVID-19, Canadians are not scared to go get tested for fear of having to pay for tests. They get tested even if they didn\'t visit the "hot" countries. Did I mention that Canada had testing available for the first patient in late January? Local hospital testing which was then verified by the federal lab. The federal lab equivalent to CDC lab wasn\'t rejecting tests. The whole world had information on how to build tests and most of the countries started to prepare for it as soon as they got the info. For anyone with a brain knew that it was a matter of time when the virus would reach every country. It\'s WHEN and not IF. \n\nSo how can a country that focuses on cost be more prepared than a country that focuses on quality. Because to make these statements is ridiculous. Sorry for the long rant.'

b"The virus is not political. The response absolutely is.\n\nThe US is 100x behind on testing from where it ought to be, because of incompetence and, mostly, political calculus from the top.

b'I\'m sure these things are being considered (as well as using lots of other spaces temporarily for non-critical patients), all of which will push the "capacity line" up, but we\'ll still hard limits on other things, like health care workers (who can get sick, too), vents, supplies, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that epidemics are on an exponential growth curve, while health care resources are at best linear.'
b'Except all the worry about not being extreme enough has done is made people complacent about the upcoming risk. \n\nThis is the same logic as the messaging around "We\'re going to tell people mask are completely useless because if they realize they actually help, we\'re going to run out of them."\n\nIntentionally lying to your populace about easily verifiable information is corrosive to the public trust necessary to get us through the next epidemic.'
b'The area under the curve is equal in both scenarios which implies that we can gain a lot by simply slowing down the rate of infection. Given that the peak of the curve is just 2x above capacity, this feels like a doable, high impact intervention.\n\nThe reality is, with uncontrolled spread, the peak is going to be 20 - 50x above capacity and spreading it out more is merely going to bring it down to 5 - 10x above capacity for a whole year or more. The highest impact intervention we have now is to *reduce* the peak, not delay it. If we delay without reducing, everyone is gonna have a lot worse of a time than this pretty graph implies.'
b"Can you imagine how many asymptomatic people are carrying the virus right now? How many people that haven't been tested? You'd have to be a fool to believe that only 110,000 people are infected right now. The Iranian government is downplaying everything connected to the virus, scientists and researchers agree there is no way only 7,110 people are infected and 237 have died, calculations and analysis show there are probably around 20,000 thousand people infected and deaths most likely in the thousands.

As of Tuesday\xc2\xa0morning, for comparison, Covid-19 had infected over 79,000 people across 28 countries, with 2,069 cases reported outside of China.\n\n> Labelling H1N1 a pandemic was controversial, however. The WHO\xc2\xa0defined\xc2\xa0the term simply as a \xe2\x80\x9cworldwide spread of a new disease.\xe2\x80\x9d Critics later\xc2\xa0noted\xc2\xa0that WHO officials lowered the organization\xe2\x80\x99s criteria for\xc2\xa0defining\xc2\xa0a pandemic shortly beforehand.\n\n> Previously, a viral outbreak\xe2\x80\x99s mortality rate had to reach a certain level\xe2\x80\x94in addition to contagion going international\xe2\x80\x94for it to qualify for the pandemic label. Facing a lack of consensus on the proper definition of the word, the WHO appears to have done away with the word \xe2\x80\x9cpandemic\xe2\x80\x9d altogether, at least in its official terminology.\n\n\nhttps://fortune.com/2020/02/25/coronavirus-pandemic-who/'

b'CNN is not nearly as left leaning as people think. They also did a shit ton to protect the bush administration. Their problem is not that they are politically motivated, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they are profit motivated and they are lazy. They never do investigative reporting and rarely take an editorialized stance on anything. They do surface level reporting as fast as possible, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fact check, they figure out whatever narrative will make them to most money and they go with it. \n\nOnly with the Trump impeachment have I seen them start to take any sort of stance on politics as opposed to just quickly showing both sides as if they\xe2\x80\x99re even, but they still had plenty of trump defenders on even though they would grill them much more harshly. However this was a rarity and the thing that conservatives never realize is liberals hate cnn just as much as the right does. \n\nYou have news outlets like the New York Times, MSNBC, and, to a much lesser extent, NPR which are all much more left leaning than CNN but they are all much more trustworthy news outlets in the sense of if they are reporting something then it\xe2\x80\x99s much less likely to be a false or non impactful story. Their skew just comes from which accurate stories they choose to run. \n\nPeople who analyze the trustworthiness and political leanings is different news outlets always put CNN as moderately untrustworthy but centrist.'

b'You are the one talking about 98% surviver rate and it being just all harmless.

Maybe "only" 2% will die or maybe even only 0.5% will die. Those deaths will be sad, but they will not be the real problem. Having 10% of all infected in need of an ICU can bring any health system to a collapse, if the infections cannot be contained.\n\nTelling Corona is "harmless" and "just a flu" leads to people not taking it serious and that leads to less containment.'

b'I\'m not saying everyone thinks the same, I\'m just saying the media narrative changed from "wow Trump and his supporters are xenophobes" when he first closed flights to "Trump is trying to kill us all omg" real quick.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. First, there is plenty of data on the WHO website, although most of it is Influenza-related. That\xe2\x80\x99s the pandemic everyone was waiting for. Not that people weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting or planning for an outbreak of a novel virus, there\xe2\x80\x99s been plans for that too - but it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to plan, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know in advance what kind of virus it will be and how it will behave. SARS-CoV-2 is a nastier one (in terms of contagiousness versus mortality) than most assumptions would\xe2\x80\x99ve been previously. \n\nAnd that said, the influenza documentation still provides plenty of useful information for the current situation, just not always 1-to-1 applicable. \n\nSecond, as with any transnational governing body, it leaves public exposure mostly to the member states, ie the ones with the higher (democratic) legitimacy. By nature, it must work mostly behind the scenes, coordinating (but not dictating) policy, and streamlining information flows between countries. \n\nAnd of course, specific measures must be different from place to place - even within countries. But there is a large similarity in responses - just look at the travel advice almost all countries are giving now. Italy has gone for the Wuhan model in response to it\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak in Lombardy. Most other European countries follow the initial Italian response. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s party due to coordination from the ECDC, but they in turn coordinate with WHO.'
b'I said what my point was multiple times in that text..'
b'Chances are if your wife, friends, parents & siblings *all* got it they still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die. Pandemics happen. People do get sick and do die but freaking out about it isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping anyone.'
b"First,i dont even technically considered a broken window fallacy. But regardless No, because the money spent by the retirees or their caretakers is USED to employ someone else. Older people naturally get sick, how many nurses, doctors, hospice, and other various caretakers do you think currently make their living on the fact the elderly simply EXIST and need care? They feed their families with that income, kids go to school. I dont see how the BWF applies. It does not make sense for a fully developed capitalist nation to shoot itself in the foot by eliminating the elderly, in ANY way. That's like killing the sick and making healthcare workers unemployed...guys, it's not that hard to understand."
b'Thanks for humoring me, I agree it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m inherently a skeptic, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t tend to believe something is happening unless I see proof. But it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible the WHO has been coordinating behind the scenes and most countries are just choosing to ignore them.'
b"Add a million sick people and the drop barely changes. I'd estimate at something like 100 million *deaths* and I'd consider it a pandemic. I don't know if deaths of cases should be used as the reasoning to call it a pandemic. The way I think about it, If 100 million got sick, about 2-5 million would die. Not that much when compared to 7 billion. Still just a drop"
b'Chances are if my aging parents got it, they have a very real risk of premature death.\n\nMy dude, an aversion to potentially lethal infectious diseases is a natural and vital instinct. You are trying to stigmatize a rational alarmist reaction as \xe2\x80\x9cfreaking out\xe2\x80\x9d. Failure of this instinct can put you and your community in an avoidable life or death situation.\n\nArrogance and ignorance on a massive scale will be the leading cause of death in this pandemic, same as the Spanish flu. Our society is so sheltered that we think we\xe2\x80\x99re immune to things like plagues, famines, and natural disasters. It\xe2\x80\x99s causing us to ignore our natural instincts and stigmatize people with a totally normal reaction. We will see much death that could\xe2\x80\x99ve been easily avoided had we taken action two months ago. As usual, our hubris is our downfall.'
b"If those old rich people died their money would still be used, hopefully for something more useful.  It's not like their money would disappear."
b'On the contrary, they\xe2\x80\x99re being applied. Just compare the COVID19 guidelines issued by the CDC and the ECDC. Different formats, but suspiciously similar language. Which points to both those documents being wrappers around WHO guidelines. \n\nAgain, implementation on the ground can (and should) be different, depending on where the epidemic is in that specific region. Wait for Wuhan- and Lombardy style quarantines to come to a country near you. It really is a matter of time.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not being arrogant. You should be aware just not overly concerned. Wash your hands, go about your life. What else can you do? Worst case scenario 2% of the worlds pop dies from this. Highly unlikely. It will be widespread, a vaccine will be developed, herd immunity will be gained, life will go on. \n    The biggest danger and threat to life is from socioeconomic collapse from people overreacting.'
b"> The biggest danger and threat to life is from socioeconomic collapse from people overreacting.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d get massive economic trouble just from automation replacing truck drivers. Happy thoughts isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to avoid that in context of 2% dying. Not by a long shot.\n\nAt least with panic and concern we can urge preventive measures to lower the death toll. Eye rolling \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just a flu. It\xe2\x80\x99s just 2%. It\xe2\x80\x99s just your kid you can make more. What was your grandma doing to help stimulate the economy anyway.

They will say "If you\'re sick, please stay home and look after your health" - maybe comment on how pandemics are only contained by how strong the public is at looking after themselves.\n\nAnd that\'s it. When nobody goes home because it\'s either work your shitty job for your shitty pay or not make rent, a lot of moral rules get bent.\n\nAnd then after that, when infections continue to exponentially climb, company execs will just shrug and say they did the best they could.'

The issue is testing. We all need to be tested before we pass it to someone else.

b"It's insane that the government has to ask nicely for employers to comply with this overly polite request.

b"I worked an entire shift with a 104\xc2\xb0 fever when I was a bartender,  because I didn't have a choice.  We bartenders ran the whole bar alone, and were not allowed to call in sick. We did not get PTO or sick leave...if we wanted time off, we got someone to cover for us and we didn't get paid for it.  \n\nNo one was willing to cover for me last minute (fever came on suddenly) and if I didn't show up I could have been fired. Fortunately for me, I now work for a company with PTO,  but sadly there are many people in my situation. \n\nPS - I didn't have anything contagious, but an EMT customer took one look at me, asked me if I'd checked my temperature, and told me to go to the ER...which I did, after work."
b"That's on the employers."
b"This advice is so vague as to be almost useless.\n\n- Is he saying that you should stay home if you show **any** symptoms of fever/cough/flu at all, regardless of severity? \n- Has any arrangements been made to deal with the impact of removing a substantial portion of the working population if this policy is implemented? I'm thinking of unintended consequences- like the closure of schools in Japan leading to the reduction of medical staff who have to stay home to babysit their kids.\n- How is this supposed to work? Do you just phone your boss and tell him you're taking time off? I see **that** working out well.\n\nThe way these ad-hoc advice is being released by the current administration is... not confidence inspiring."
b"I've been waiting for something from my work offering extended sick time to cover it if we get it. The other day they just posted something that basically just said stay home if you're sick and had us redo our food safety quizzes. I have about a week of sick pay. After that, I can't really be out of work. So I guess we'll see what happens."
b'Thats funny as too they will not respect it and people will point out and get fired.'
b"How sick is sick enough? I've got a bit of sniffles and a very very slight cough. Do i quarantine?"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m driving to work now with a nasty cold/possible flu because we are desperately short on staff (nurse). Bring on the surgical masks and non-stop handwashing and keeping my fingers crossed charge or management sends me home. Can\xe2\x80\x99t stay home when patients are coming in 24/7'
b'let me rephrase this a bit: Employer, if you do not support this you are a fucking moron.'
b"Great advice except., if I miss more than 3 days I am required to have a Doctor's note.  \n\nSince you can't get tested no Doctor is going to write me a note saying I can't come to work for 2+ weeks to not spread the Virus if I get it.  (assuming my symptoms are fairly mild)\n\nNot to mention my job doesn't give sick days so I wouldn't get paid."
b"Unless the federal government gives employers money to pay people with, you won't see massive PTO increases.\n\nMost American businesses are small, and can't afford PTO under normal circumstances, let alone with reduced income.  Google US small business statistics sba for more info.\n\nThings aren't too bad yet, I'm already dealing with some Corona virus related problems with my small business.  If we get mandatory closures without some sort of financial assistance, a lot of Americans will be jobless because their jobs won't exist anymore."

b'The CDC\xc2\xa0said that so far this season, 34 million people have gotten\xc2\xa0the flu,\xc2\xa0and about 20,000 have died....so yeah.'
b"My employer just gave all employees an additional five paid sick days for the year, to make sure we don't come in sick. If you have to be quarantined beyond that, you can use short-term disability to keep getting paid. I'm super lucky to work for an employee-owned business, though."
b'HAHAHHAHAHAHA!\n\nMy wife came down with a horrible respiratory infection here in the US (PNW). Her parents and I took her to the hospital stat.\n\nThe nurse fucked up her IV and she ended up dripping blood on the ground and in tears: she still has the purple stains from the blood leaked under her skin. Either way, at least she got her medicine. \n\nShe is a type-1 diabetic. That shit is fucking genetic, so if you have any comments about "Americans fat, you deserve diabetes" save \'em: you can shove them up your fucking ass and get fucked. \n\nOur state has recently enacted mandatory paid sick-leave, one of the very few in the whole nation to have this. Within the local context, that means shit however. Every time a law like this is passed, shitty businesses find a way to pass the tab on to their workers or straight up defy it. A seafood processor gave their employees (mostly immigrants) a letter saying "while the state has passed X law, our company policy is different".\n\nHer workplace policy is that you need to be gone MORE THAN 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS to be able to apply, because of course, you have to apply and it is up to them to come up with reasons why they can\'t give it to you. Those of you who are smart, noticed that this is basically 8 consecutive days instead. She gets sick on sunday, spends all week recovering, on sunday she is ok-ish, but her sick-leave policy does not apply since it wasn\'t 5 consecutive work days or more. She just lost over 1500 dollars in income, and her nice government insurance still left her with a 500 dollar co-pay (thank fucking god, that is cheap around here). \n\nShe is a professional who works for the state government btw. \n\nImagine the poor dude working at a warehouse or at the airport polishing floors? \n\nThose people are going to die and do so while in medical debt. Funerals around here start at about 7000 for a crap casket and a video/slideshow of your miserable life in bad resolution-pictures.\n\nSo yeah, that dude is disconnected from reality when asking people to stay at home.'
b'They can try but companies don\xe2\x80\x99t have an endless reserve of savings.  Some are living AR to AR and using lines of credit to finance working capital.     Little businesses are going to get crushed by this. While they should have enough money to cover any normal PTO and Vacation, beyond that, it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the bank accounts to run dry.  Some will do better than others but I suspect like most Americans, most companies are living paycheck to paycheck. I have do idea about the cash reserves of publicly traded companies, but SMBs will burn up pretty quick. \n\nTo put in perspective:  26m companies in the USA. Only around 20k are publicly traded. 95% are 3 employees and less than $500k/yr.   I tiny fraction of companies have gross revenues in excess of $1m/yr.  \n\nSMBs employ the bulk of the workforce.  \n\nThis is going to be very painful economically.   But if we don\xe2\x80\x99t pull together and slow this down, the health care system will be overwhelmed and there will be needless death.   \n\nThis is a national emergency.   We should start acting like it.  \n\nIf you are still reading this, you are the resistance.  Social distancing NOW.'

b"Who goes to work sick? My boss would send me home immediately if I came to work sick - although it never occurred to me to go to work sick. If I have a cold I stay home for a week instead of infecting my colleagues.\n\nUsually it's like this: you're sick, you call the company and say you're sick, then you go to the doctor (usually your family doctor) and get a confirmation. This confirmation does not contain the exact diagnosis, because this is a private matter and does not concern the employer. Later you give this medical confirmation to the employer, usually by email. You come back to work when you are healthy, no matter how long it takes.  You will receive full pay (including bonuses) as long as you are sick, even if you are sick for months - but a doctor must confirm this. The company must pay the full wage for between 6 and 12 weeks, depending on how long you work already at this company, then half the wage for 4 weeks.  The state health insurance company then pays the rest, so you always get 100% of the salary you would get without illness.\n\nIn order to relax and to be less at risk of falling ill, holidays are very important. Statutory holiday (vacation days) entitlement is 5 weeks per year (people who have worked more than 26 years are entitled to 6 weeks), fully paid, of course.  On top of that there is an extra monthly salary, which is tax-privileged. So you get a more than two monthly salaries during vacation (for Christmas there is an additional monthly salary extra). On top of that, there are 13 public holidays for which the normal salary is also paid, unless they fall on a Sunday. If I get sick during my vacation days, this is no longer counted as vacation days, but as sick leave - which means that I can make up for this vacation days later.\n\nIf you are prevented from working, you are entitled to full pay for a maximum of one week, depending on the case, but you are obliged to avoid being prevented from working if possible. Typical cases of incapacitation would be:\n\nVisit to the doctor (only if the doctor is only open during your working hours or in case of acute pain), own wedding, death and funeral or wedding of a close relative, witness in court, no travel to the place of work due to natural disasters, moving house, birth of a child (for the father, mothers are not allowed to work for 8 weeks before the birth date anyway, but get this paid by the state health insurance).\n\nNone of this is a special performance of the company, but is required by law for the whole country - every company has to handle it this way. Trump and FOX call this socialism.\n\nAmericans, change your system, the current one exploits you."

b"Some of my co-workers work full time (state job) but are not considered permanent employees so they don't get sick or annual leave.

b"When I started where I'm working now back in 2008, they had unlimited sick leave. I was like what? That is unheard of. Their mentality back then was that if people would really stay home when they were sick and that policy had been in place for a long time. Then a couple of years ago they ended it because a bunch of people abused the policy and stayed home sick for weeks at a time when they weren't sick. They still give us 12 days of sick days off which is still unbelievable but it's a use or lose policy and now a bunch of people suddenly get sick in December right before it resets."

b'Congratulations: your expertly skilled comment just squarely utilized every letter of the alphabet! Wow!'
b'Lol'
b'"Democrats introduce.." RIP that bill.'
b'Sadly they never say what bill it is.\n\nIs it this one?\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1185/all-info\n\nIt seems not right though. That makes basically a flu sick leave office and administration overhead. Not the simple solution the hill is talking about.'
b'The easy way to ensure this passes is to make the tax breaks these companies get every year dependent upon them offering the 2 weeks paid.  It\xe2\x80\x99s at least a way to get the lobbyists out of the way.'
b'The scary word might fix the problem >!democratic socialism !<'
b"What is the most admirable creature on God's green Earth? Why, it's the bee! Have you ever seen a bee on vacation? Have you ever seen a bee take a sick day? Well, my friends, the answer is no! So I say, be\xe2\x80\xa6 the bee! Be the bee!"
b'TBF, the bill is actually "let employees accrue 7 days paid sick time" AND make an additional 14 days available immediately during health emergencies.\n\nSo assuming you had already accrued 7 days, you would have those to use for those other things. (But I still totally agree even with 7 extra it\'s not enough)'
b'Or actually gets the virus or gets quarantined again.'
b"Well hopefully that's what happens.\n\nIf people start getting sick and can't get hospital treatment without paying for it or get clean water or food then the 327 million people living in the USA, many of whom are armed with serious guns won't care about a bailout or the stock market or money or banks."
b"Here in Germany, you're required to have a doctor's note to utilize a paid sick day. (Which is also a lot easier because doctor's visits of this nature are completely covered by insurance.)"
b"Why are these bullshit excuses always used for the US can't do something but they never stopped any of the countries that have these things and have had them for decades?"
b'There are tons of ways to curb the potential abuse of this. Regardless, all else equal, I think possible abuse of power should be given to the workers rather than the employers. Employers have been abusing the system for decades through poor pay, poor benefits, etc.'
b"It's not supposed to be a comparison.  It's a slippery slope joke..."
b"Employers with low wage workers don't give a shit if they die, they can be replaced in 5 minutes."

b'> If I have 4 call offs in 6 months im fired.\n\nthats actually illegal. So the official reason for firing will be different.'
b"It's nothing special. I am from another European country, and here you always get 100% of the salary (and bonus) as long as you are sick - no matter how long it takes. And that is up to you and your doctor, not the company. That is the law, all companies have to act according to it. This is a matter of course for most western, rich countries (well, except the USA)."
b'Europeans: What are hospital/medical/doctor bills? Never seen one.\n\nAmericans, you need to change your system.'
b"It also makes your illness last longer if you don't actually rest! Take a sick day and *sleep*. I have coworkers who come to work sick, coughing everywhere, and then they're like that for three weeks. If they'd just stayed home and rested and let their body actually recover, it probably would have lasted a fraction of that long."
b'Wish I could upvote you more. Yeah I get pto, but I\xe2\x80\x99m part time with chronic health issues so it takes forever to get, and is gone instantly. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really scary right now, if they close schools? Fucked. If they close work? Fucked. \n\nNo one wants to go to work sick or spread it or anything, we just have such an absolute shit country that only cares about corporations and the wealthy. It puts you in an awful place. Potentially spread something you might have and risk other people? Or stay home and 100% lose everything you have because you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to miss work.'
b'My Fiancee and I found out recently it is cheaper for us to be on separate healthcare plans, which sucks, especially with what mine covers it would be more helpful to her. While I was looking at the cost of that I saw what my premiums would be for family coverage, that alone was like "yep, that is financial no to children".'
b'I totally understand this. I am so lucky to have sick pay. I took some unpaid time after my child was born and it took us months to catch up on our finances.'
b'Get your group together and go to HR. Tell HR that they either send the sick lady home **now** or all of you are calling out sick **now**.'
b'The family that works together shares illnesses together! T-thats how the saying goes, right?'
b"Wage theft is higher than *all* property in USA. We need local state and federal government to create good laws like paud sck leave for all companies with more than somany works - and the actually *enforce* those laws. \n\nAlso see article s in how it's enforcement has continuously dropped for high income will ramping up on poor and low income .."
b'I need a cigarette'
b"ok well thats not your fault, they should hire more people. If they are struggling then higher ups deal with the problem not the ''team'' or you. This is why i got out of those warehouse jobs. Slimey fucking business but stable money."
b'Yep, work in a factory and when someone calls in sick manager somehow expects me to be able to do same amount of work without that person somehow lol...then again I called in sick more than my coworkers haha'
b'Only with a cherry on top \xf0\x9f\x8d\x92'
b"I am sure that because they used this majic word, employeer will make sure to jump at the chances to do as asked. The truth is, we are profit 1st and everything else is second so no matter how it's asked, it will be ignored unless it benefits the corporation"
b'How disgusting is that?! They want sick people serving other people food and getting the customers sick too just so they can turn a profit.'
b'Which one is it so I know not to eat there and give them my business?'
b'Well not if 20% of the country is dying'
b">Oh, not t\n\nyes the freedom to walk into management's office with covid-19 and start coughing.. 'MERICA  FUCK YEAH!"
b'Honestly, I am surprised that freedom is much better back home in Europe than here. Well, besides the freedom of having a gun, yes, that one is much stronger here.\n\nBut it kind of clicks when you realize its perfectly legal to open carry a gun here, but you can get in trouble for open carrying a can of beer on the street.'
b'Risky for whom? GDP per capita in the European welfare states is comparable to that of the USA. So, who would lose if the US were to better protect the broad masses of ordinary workers?'
b'Long story short, our HR is not very good at being HR'
b"My kids school sent out an email that everyone needs to download an app, and get familiar with it in case they cancel in-person classes and move to online only. \n\nAnd for those who don't have internet access, they somehow have plans to enlist the help of one of our public broadcast TV stations, and will be giving lessons and homework on there, with a hotline set up for students/families with questions on schoolwork.  \n\nI'm quite impressed. I hope more schools/districts are doing this."
b'Can you imagine how fast this will spread in an Elementary school?!? Just stomach bugs travel fast.. This would be horrible.'
b'Like what?'
b'U.K. is the European version of the USA. All for the 1% at the top and - because Europe - for the 10% at the bottom. Who pays on top is the middle class, who now turn crazy people into premiers.'
b'Damn I\'ve worked at my company 12 years and get 4 weeks and 5 "sick days" that are included in those 4 weeks. Haha'
b'Same here. Job advertised 21 PTO, sick days and holidays. I was like "Oh wow, 21 vacation days, and sick days, and holidays? That\'s amazing." Even mentioned it to the recruiter and she didn\'t say anything.\n\nGot into the job, realized ALL of it is pushed into one pile. I\'m forced to take time off for like Christmas or Thanksgiving, even if I don\'t want to and it all comes out of my pool. It\'s all accrued and on the same schedule.\n\n21 days is "generous" for most Americans, but I felt lied to and it really soured my first couple of weeks at this job that really never got much better.'
b'yeah americans should get at minimum 14 days a year off regardless. Times are rough right now and most of us are working alot of hours to make ends meet'
b'Man the biggest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt from this is how crap sick pay is in the USA. Here in the UK my last 2 jobs I\xe2\x80\x99ve had 6 months full pay, 6 months half for sick leave, plus 30 days holiday + bank holidays PTO. \n\nAre you guys alright? I think you need a Bernie revolution hard over there or something haha'
b'My company has both, but anytime you are sick, the first 16 hrs comes out of PTO.... so many people wont call in.'
b'Your employer/insurance plan does not offer short/long term disability time?'
b'What state are you in now... ?'
b'Sounds like this would have beena situation where Short term disability insurance might have been helpful. Does your company offer that as a benefit?'
b"Companies that do this, tend to add both sick and PTO days to a total number of days allowed. The employee's do not lose anything, but simpler reporting, less legal issues or complications. No more bullshit around is it sick? is it not? do yo need a doc note?  etc.\n\neg: You get 19 days off per year, use it as you wish. The math works out the same."
b'If I get sick on my holiday, that day does not count as a holiday day.\n\nAll of Sweden is like that.\n\nThe US is just totally fucked up.'
b'Yeah ours just takes it out of our pto pool'
b"It's not huge. It's lower than mandatory PTO in most countries."
b'Does PTO in your case lump in sick days as well?\n\n\nAnd I also assume that weekends are not counted as PTO?'
b"I'm guessing you work an office job.\n\nLets see what food service does (not) do and watch how dangerous that will be."
b"Fingers crossed my company goes this route. Currently they use are PTO if we call in. Its 14 days of quarantine if you get the coronavirus,  I work 5 days a week, I don't want to waste 10 days of my PTO."
b"My work is a desk job FOR a major US city with some of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases. I had a terrible cold last week and asked my employer if I could work from home, so I didn't alarm my colleagues with my cough. They said no and I had to come into work all week. Oh, and I'm 32 weeks pregnant."
b'A lot of people are hospitalized for weeks though'
b"Honestly, they should have said if anyone try's coming into work  exhibiting symptoms, they'll be fired."
b'Can you source that please? Happy cake day btw.'
b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one good thing about this eventual pandemic (and of course, it will be a singular island of a good thing amidst a vast sea of awful), it\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility it will wake the rest of America up to the notion that our workplace standards (compensated sick leave being rare, health insurance tied to employment, etc) are uniquely terrible and need reform.'
b'im screwed if i get sick'
b'Man every time I get sick all I can hear is my one manager going "well if your realllly sick you can stay home".'
b'I work through illness. From home. Where I can\xe2\x80\x99t spread my disease.\n\nMost colds don\xe2\x80\x99t knock you out from being able to do work. That still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should go spread it around.'
b"Because you're not a team player or serious about the job and someone will get promoted over you. Oh you shouldn't take much FMLA off either cuz else you look bad. Said by my own dad.\n\nSeriously fuck the boomers and Puritans who arrived here and started pressing witches in a few decades."
b'I would have to say it\'s a bit of both.  In my line of work, you are given paid time off, but are highly discouraged from using it ("take your vacation when you are in your lay off period." -manager), which of course leads to co-workers ragging on even taking a single day for sick or pleasure.  It\'s some machismo bullshit.'
b'Great point bc coming/going to work sick is a social mind set  bc folks dn want to risk the social opprobrium   they might get by staying at home!'
b"We have no limit on paid sick days and a very relaxed work from home policy, we still come in sick. There's definitely still a stigma or a mindset that unless you're bedridden you should be at work that's clearly very pervasive in our culture."
b"I know my dad is in this group. Some will go to work sick because if they use their PTO they will fall behind on certain projects, miss deadlines, etc that may cause them more stress anyway, so they'd rather just work through it. He only uses his PTO during times work is slow and he can go on a vacation or something."
b'my husband is a union electrician. he has zero PTO. if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. if his company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a project for him, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. his company was already slow and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a place to go for this week. \n\nwe live in a major US city, and i predict in the next few weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on some kind of shut down. and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way in hell his company or the union is giving any PTO. i have no idea what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.'
b'Ironically, the place I work at is a union shop.  Most of these union people complain about being overworked but still support politicians that want to destroy unions and roll back protections for laborers.'
b"I guess I'm that Euroweenie that left America for those handouts. Oh well!"
b"Exactly! If you are with an illness, and you can't afford healthcare, it simply means you didn't work hard enough and you deserve to die, those lazy drains of society."
b'For the rich.'

b'That old guy on the princess cruise ship is still carrying the virus after 21 days! Chinese had to extend quarantine to 28 days after discovering some people still registering as infected post symptom stage. All it takes is a few people who are infected after a massive quarantine to cause a resurgence all over again. If we do create a vaccine in 18 months, it will be a world record in fastest vaccine ever created by humanity. After its creation, they will not have 7 billion vaccines instantly on hand either.

b"trying to get a doctor's note here in the us right now,  might be kind of tough.   i personally don't go to the doctor everytime i feel under the weather,  and i would suspect a ton of other people are in the same boat.   also if im sick,  (...not deatlhy sick), the last thing i want to do i drag my butt out if bed and sit in a doctor's office."
b"That's still unreasonable if you have to do that for even just 1 or 2 days. If I have a migraine, I can't even safely take myself to a doctor. I may not even be able to speak or compose an intelligible email for a while. Moreover, the doctor can't do anything but tell me to get the fuck back home and rest.\n\nForcing a doctor's visit and note just infantilizes the working adult population, waste's the doctor's time, and at best prevents the sick person from resting and puts them in contact with people sick with other things."
b"We get a bill well over a hundred dollars for a basic doctor visit here in the states. That's with insurance. This makes it near impossible for low income people to get in to a clinic to get a doctors note. Now, you lose out on wages AND have to pay to see a doctor."
b"Depends on the employer though. With most you can take 3 sick days in a row before you need a doctor's note."
b"A doctor's note would cost me $200 :("

b"Like paid sick leave provided by the government so your employer doesn't have to."
b'Washington State recently passed a law (I think two years ago) where everyone pays \xe2\x80\x9cillness premiums,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really a new form of tax (it\xe2\x80\x99s important they call it something else because Washington State does not have any income tax).\n\nThe idea is we all pay into a fund, and then when people need to take sick leave they can, and the government pays for their sick time, up to some number of week.\n\nBut this is for sick *leaves* not sick *days*. Leaves are extended periods of time, more than three days, like the two weeks you\xe2\x80\x99d need with COVID-19.\n\nThey also have a new requirement that employees be allowed to accrue sick time that companies will pay for, to deal with sick days.\n\nBoth programs also enable you to take care of someone that is sick in your family.\n\nThese kinds of programs are the kinds we need. Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for this thread, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details because my employer offers unlimited paid sick time (lucky me) so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to investigate the law as much. I know they take a portion of my earnings to pay the fund, and I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that because I\xe2\x80\x99d rather pay for others to receive benefits in ways that make sense.\n\nUnfortunately now the program is flooded with applicants and is falling behind. This was true even before COVID-19, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better unless it\xe2\x80\x99s getting more resources.'
b">y lots of people while they are shut down, when their customers are cancelling orders or avoiding new purchases.  When they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cash to pay the mortgage, utilities, invoices for inventory,  they also can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the wages.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of what they want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they can do.  We should be prepared to see emergency financing facilities like in previous crises and it will be a shit show of people screaming about bailouts and who gets them.\n\n we tax all of them uniformly and progressively so it's equitable (not equal) across the board and prevents one business from cutting it to gain an advantage over their competition."
b'Always get the policies fully explained in writing before you consider the offer.'
b'We get 10 PTOs, 10 calendar holidays and 3 sick leave. If we work a Saturday or a Calendar holiday due to a production release we get an extra PTO.\n\nI used to work in Europe. We had 15 Calendar holidays, 32 PTOs, unlimited sick time with doctors note. if I worked any of the Calendar holidays I got additional PTO. I was able to take a Month of vacation back home every year as well as many short 2-3 day breaks when work wasnt super busy to go visit neigboring countries.'
b'21 days including holidays and sick days is awful.  The US has about 10 holidays they celebrate so you are actually only getting about 2 weeks of combined sick time and vacation time that isn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to a holiday.'
b'This is not typical. PTO polices EXCLUDE company holidays.'
b'The problem is abuse.\n\nMost places implement a use it or lose it. Hardly ever does a company pay you out for any time you did not take at the end of the Fiscal year'
b"....but what about the CEO's million dollar bonuses that they so desperately need?!!!!!   (Sarcasm)"
b'Yes. Yes we do.'
b"They do (have to pay extra for it), but it would only paid about 1/2 of my salary and wouldn't pay me until I was out for a month.  As the primary caregiver with 4 kids I couldn't afford to do that."
b'Same in Poland, 26 days PTO per annum and unlimited paid sick leave at 80% base salary.'
b'That is basically the case in almost all - at least rich - countries in the whole world.'
b'US. One time I had scheduled a vacation, got food poisoning while there and was basically sitting in the bathroom for 2.5 days out of 4 when I got back. My boss said "that sucks, but at least you\'re back here!" I didn\'t have a vacation and they thought it was great that I was back at my desk. Such a stupid mentality.'
b'Uh I work in the US for one of the companies that regularly makes the "worst employer" lists and we have the same policy.  If I get sick on vacation, I get to use a sick day instead of vacation day.'

b'Yeah I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure all major shipping companies are not giving free paid time off and all those drivers come into contact with a ton of people.'
b'I work in a local butcher shop for a large loblaws chain and theyll hire people part time, give them full time hours then they dont get sick days or PTO. Just a lump sum vacation pay in summer. Only the full timers get PTO and sick days. Gotta squeeze every dollar into profits!'
b'Almost twenty years ago I used to work in retail and the store managers would give us some serious grief if we tried to call in sick. Sometimes they would ask for a doctors note...\n\nI was so irritated and wanted to say \xe2\x80\x9clook I\xe2\x80\x99m a part time worker who works 40+ hours a week. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the crappy health plan and I don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick leave so if I call in sick I don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid which hurts me financially\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nI am not going to spend money I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the doctors office if I feel like crap for a day or two and just self quarantine myself in my bedroom.\n\nOthers would drag their sick butts into work hacking on their hands, putting their hands on product as they pack your bags.'
b"I am a restaurant general manager. Last week I thought I might be coming down with strep, and was facing absolutely no option to stay away from my store. A few weeks ago, I was suffering some sort of weird stomach bug that was more pain than action, but I still had to show up and do my job 6 days that week.\n\nModern life relies heavily on fast food, and yet we overlook serious protections necessary to ensure that food service is provided safely. People want their food as cheap as possible, so I don't even really blame my FOO (boss) for being unable to pay me sick leave (we are seeing increases in sales volume yet have to cut labor hours to afford operations costs, because franchise restaurants are very low profit outfits (with rising food costs, mandatory low price menu deals, skyrocketing rent and insurance rates, etc.)."

b"That's literally the fucking point of why we need it"
b'Sounds fantastic'
b"Liberal welfare states are a bit different from social democracy (which is what most people mean by democratic socialism). The main difference is that social democracy doesn't bother with means testing every program, it makes them universal to reduce complexity and maximize access.\n\nFor example, currently student financial aid is gatekept by family income. However, if you get denied a grant due to your parents high income, they have no obligation to pay for your tuition and you may be stuck with high interest loans despite having a need for the aid if they refuse to help.\n\nHealthcare is also greatly simplified by giving universal access. This is done across the developed world and even in some less developed parts.\n\nFor an example in the US, just look at K-12 education. No one thinks we should means test parents and charge a sliding scale of tuition for your kid to go to school. Education is considered a basic, universal right and is taxpayer funded in its entirety for simplicity and maximum equity."
b'The idea is that America is so entrenched in capitalism that without flat out destroying every federal branch, every upper level executive in every american company, including banks, capitalism won\'t be deconstructed. And even then you have a lot of the working class kind of brainwashed into defending the shit anyways.\n\nSo "democratic socialism" or whatever it\'s called is the next best thing.\n\nBut hey, maybe covid19 will do exactly that.'

Not a chance.\n\nMy kids daycare just sent out a notice that any child found with a fever will be asked to stay home for 48 hours instead of only 24. Like that's gonna do anything."
b"In Australia they brought in medical certificates at the pharmacy. You go in with symptoms and they assess you. eg a bad cold you don't function well so why turn up and infect others.  \nDoctor is free because of nationalised medicine.\n\nPharmacy medical certificate costs money so if not really sick then lose money for sickpay."
b"What he or she said about Germany isn't entirely true. It's when you miss 3 consecutive days of work or more that you definitely need a doctor's note."
b"In the UK, I can self-certify as sick for 7 days. If I want paid sick leave after that, I need a doctor's note."
b'It isn\'t required until day 3 off of work. \n\nThis mind set is the thing I do not miss from the US. There are a ton of GPs around me. It takes less than 5 minutes for me to get to a doctors office on foot. The next closest is in the center of my town, a 5 minute tram ride away. \n\nIt also isn\'t "[a] waste of time" or "infantaliz[ing] the adult population." It allows doctors here to prevent potentially serious illnesses that could crop up from not treating something.\n\nIn the US on the other hand, you don\'t have the "luxury" of just walking to your local GP, having them immediately accept your insurance and you actually get to talk to someone. In the states when I was still living there, you had to find a GP that was in-network, you\'d have to make an appointment, then figure out how to get to that appointment because it sure as fuck wasn\'t within walking distance, then wait for 2+ hours to talk to a doctor, and then you get to pay for the pleasure. \n\nI get it, the mindset is different, but just because the system in the US doesn\'t work, doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t in other countries.'
b"Let me be clear that I don't think any country in the world has a perfect system! My comment was only meant to point out that there are ways that employers wouldn't have to worry about abuse of the system. With an issue like chronic migraines, that is perhaps something which must be worked out with employers on a case by case basis."
b'Employment lawyer here (but not yours and this is not legal advice).\n\nJust last week, someone was asking me what they could do when a woman called out sick for a couple of days when her request for PTO was denied. Unfortunately, the local paid sick leave law said that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t require a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note because it was only two days. The woman had a history of doing stuff like this, too \xe2\x80\x94 in multiple years she\xe2\x80\x99d use literally all of her sick time for the year on Mondays and Fridays, and she\xe2\x80\x99d come in with contagious illnesses other times. So even if asking for a note for a 1-2 day absence is usually overkill, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prohibited. There has to be a way to prevent abuse. Requiring documentation from a medical professional is much better than letting managers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t medical professionals make judgment calls, and you invite discrimination lawsuits when you don\xe2\x80\x99t apply requirements like that across the board; requiring a note every time makes sense. And as telemedicine becomes more common, the downsides of requiring a note will get smaller.\n\nIn any case, an employee with a migraine (or another disability with intermittent flare-ups) could ask to be reasonably accommodated by being exempted from a general requirement to provide a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note to use sick leave.'

b'Same! Stay safe!'
b"Sure. But if we don't take steps to help it could be higher!"
b"They also stick everything in their mouth, and they don't wash their hands.. Also they cough right in your face!"
b'touch. Cha. My coworkers kid has a habit of licking elevator buttons.'
b'This is really going to test the actuarial work that was done to establish the sick leave fund.  Which sounds like it was maybe failing already.  \n\nCompanies who self insure their health care insurance plans especially have incentives to offer generous sick leave because a sick employee at work generates more claims (in addition to lost productivity) when they infect others.\n\nI do wonder if the state laid off some of the big event risk (pandemic) to third parties, like reinsurance or something.'
b"Yup. I learned that mistake the hard way, which sucks because one of the reasons why I took this job was because I thought it would be more PTO days which would have allowed my wife and I to travel a little bit. Won't make that mistake again."
b"They know enough people will not confront them, and just assume they're not being hazy, that they basically don't worry about it.\n\nThe one person who acts up and calls up a manager and asks them to clarify the policy and doesn't take the job is worth the fifty people who  are just ecstatic to have a job and don't realize it until they get sick for the first time and can't come to work."
b"Yeah. I've been lucky to have a manager who sometimes allows work from home when we aren't feeling well but it's completely dependent on her mood and whether or not she likes you that week. I've used it a few times to work remote but other times I just end up coming to work and disinfecting everything I touch and staying away from people because I don't have the days to spare."
b"That's what I thought too. It's how it was at my previous job in the same field at a competitor, so I thought I was getting an improvement on vacation since they were poaching people."
b'Gotcha.  Sorry to hear that.  Our country sucks in this area that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.'
b"Jesus Christ y'all live in a fucking Utopia by comparison. It's remarkable."
b'same in the UK (for now at least)'
b'So why not the self described no.1 country in the world?'
b'Exactly. But they have company cars and shit. Ridiculous.'
b'Yeah I get 15 days(after a year of service) + 9 holidays. I have to be on call with check in meetings on Black Friday, thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve, so they really aren\xe2\x80\x99t holidays. They are enacting a 7 holiday and 2 flex days for people like me, but the 2 flex days only work for other \xe2\x80\x9cfederally recognized holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d So basically I don\xe2\x80\x99t get as many holidays as everyone else since These reset in February and I can\xe2\x80\x99t take them until I\xe2\x80\x99m officially in the on call rotation for holiday which I will be as I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one on my team with this perk... \nIt takes another 5 years of service to get to 20 days pto. \nYou better believe I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to work from home the days that I\xe2\x80\x99m sick. I may not be as productive but I\xe2\x80\x99m not wasting my pto on this.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the major problem: dishonest workers using sick time frivolously. My job has PTO and a very generous occurrence policy. However, these were put into place by the Union. The company still treats us poorly, which means most employees have a lack of respect for the company. If the company treated us better, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99d have fewer unnecessary call outs'
b'One worker with Corona in a restaurant is all its going to take to put you out of business.... the law suit will be enormous'

b"Honestly, wouldn't you rather risk someone taking a couple of slacker days and paying them a grand, rather than someone getting provably sick from your service and suing for maybe 100+ times that?"
b'Yep so better to not give it'
b"Can't you ask for a doctor's note as a proof?"
b"This is true across many sectors. 4-6wks vacation, 3 sick days, and 3-5 PTO. Within 6 months a majority have used all but a couple days. Then they're angry when they get the flu and we cannot allow them to work. I've lost around a years worth of vacation at this point but my work is completed and I use my days appropriately."

b"Sorry, yes. I should have elaborated - that said, with coronavirus symptoms I'd guess one would always be taking an extended period of time off."
b"It's more like the USA is a dystopia compared to most of the industrialized world. I get unlimited sick leave and 25 days of PTO (30 next year due to company policy), and public holidays don't count towards that so that's another 10+ days of PTO."
b'I would rather live in the US than Poland 10/10 times'
b"There are some companies like this in the US. I work at a fortune 50 company and have 14 paid holidays, plus 2-5 weeks of paid vacation (every 4-5 years you get an additional week).

b'I wanted to write up on how my everyday life has changed in the last couple of months living in Korea. It\'s long but felt I wanted to share it with anyone who\'s interested.\n\n  \n\n\nHow we are dealing with CORVID-19.  \n  \nIt\'s been almost 2 months since most of my kids\' classes has stopped altogether. Some earlier than others, but for a month now, everything\'s been cancelled. School and kindergarten should\'ve started on Mar. 2nd. We\'ve been told they\'ll start on the 23rd, but one, it\'s possible they\'ll postpone the date again, and two, we don\'t know how we feel about sending the kids to school even if they actually do open. We\'re starting to worry about how this will affect the older boy\'s school work and education, and we try to give him some sort of homework for him to do, at least enough to keep him from forgetting stuff he learned in 1st grade. We had a teacher come and teach him math etc. for about 30 minutes every week, and give daily worksheet to do (fairly common in Korea). That 1 on 1 class is being held through a tablet app with video chat. Pretty cool, actually. Both kids are reading a lot of books, mostly because they get bored of playing all day. I get to read book after book after book for the little one, which I kind of like. They can\'t meet their friends which is pretty sad, and we are thankful that they have each other\'s company. I hear my colleagues with single child having much harder time trying to entertain their kids.  The younger one asks me about once a day if the Corona virus is gone yet. It breaks my heart a little bit. We all need a haircut, like last month. But we\'re just letting it grow since we probably would have to take our masks off during the cut (or at least during the shampoo process). At least the hairdressers are all working with their mask on. I know because I\'ve called them and asked. If words spread around the neighborhood that some restaurants or stores have employess working without masks on, that store\'s going to have zero customers. \n  \nMy wife is a SAHM and she\'s been spending time with the two kids 24/7. They go out for a walk about once week if the weather\'s nice, all with their mask on. It\'s actually not that bad since there are few people on the street and nearby trails (other than dog owners walking their dogs). They get to take the mask off and breath in some fresh air, which is probably due to China stopping a lot of their factories leading to cleaner air in Korea. The boys (8 and 4) have learned to enjoy each other\'s company since it is their only option. They get along much better and that\'s some burden off of my wife\'s shoulders. We don\'t go out to malls or anywhere indoor at all. We used to be able to online order fresh food before midnight and they\'d be on our front door at 7am the next day, but now they\'re often sold out. We have succeeded in ordering some stuff when we order early in the afternoon or so. We take turns going to the grocery, alone, again with our mask. I try to let her go as often as I can, so she can get at least a little time by herself, even if it\'s for a short drive to and from the store. We find ourselves buying less of fresh veggies and parishables because we don\'t want to goto the store often. We end up buying more frozen food than we\'d like. She\'s come up with so many creative ways to pass the time with the kids, often transforming normal house chores into some kind of a game, but we both agree options are running out. She\'s very tired all the time and we\'re just waiting for all this to pass.  \n  \nA lot of companies in Korea have decided to have their employees work from home. That is not the case where I work, but it could change in an instant if any one of our employees turn up to be confirmed of the virus. For now, masks are mandatory. Riding the company bus, taking the elevator, walking through halls, etc. all require masks. We have a big sign in the elevator that reads, "NO MASK, NO ELEVATOR". Koreans already tend to wear mask often when they have a cold or something, but now, you get weird looks if you\'re not wearing one within the company. Sanitizers are everywhere and we\'ve gotten acustomed to just sanitizing our hands whenever we see one, without giving it a second thought. I\'ve probably used it around 30 times today. In addition, when we goto the cafetaria, there are employees with sanitizers in both hands spraying every single employees before we get in. A few days ago, we had a plastic, transparent wall installed on our cafetaria table for every spot so people eating facing each other are blocked from any unecessary droplet infection. Most social and non-essential meetings have been either cancelled, delayed or are held over phones.  We have thermo-camera things set up so everyone entering the company gets their temperatures checked, and one of our employee goes around the office taking everyone\'s temperature twice a day. People in hazmat-like suit came in the other day to disinfect/fumigate the whole office and we had to leave for 30+ minutes, which was nice because the coffee place closest to the office closed down after the whole virus thing. We were able to walk to a coffee place further away and finally get some good coffee. We didn\'t talk much because we\'d lower our mask only to take a sip of the coffee. They say it\'s going to be a weekly event. Most business trips have stopped, especially to China. \n  \nWe get several text messages from the goverment regarding CORVID-19. It used to be used for national emergencies such as earthquake warnings, heat warnings, etc. But nowadays, they\'re all about the virus. If a confirmed case in my city is found, the city immediately messages everyone (I do mean everyone in the city. I think it\'s a feature in all Korean phones and cannot be opted out) the patient\'s age/gender/location(down to which section of the city) and where they\'ve gone in the last few days or so. It gets down to specific restaurant\'s name. We also get general reminders for washing hands, wearing masks, and not attending religious/social meetings. Starting today (9th of March), we received messages on how to go about purchasing masks.  \n  \nMasks have been a huge part of our lives for the last month or so. We take them off at home, in our own cars, and in my cubicle while working (but I do keep them Butabout half the time even in my cubicle, just in case). We hear KF80, KF94 (probably a Korean mask filter-ability standard, not sure what the global standards are) are preferable, but I do have a couple hundreds of the cheap disposable ones that I bought a few weeks before the virus broke out (the ones that surgeons use), so I just use those and dispose of them after a day of use. My main concern is my habit of touching my face inadvertantly and people coughing/sneezing close to me. All the mask you can buy online are either sold out, or have gone up crazy in price. Ones we used to be able to get for less than $1 USD costs $3~5. Because of this, Korean government decided to limit Korean mask manufacturers on how much they can export compared to domestic sales (I think it was more than 90% but not sure), and the government is buying most of the mask themselves to sell to the people for reasonable price. Basically, it\'s martial law for mask sales. They tried a few methods (which had loopholes, obviously) and seem to have decided on the current method.  \n  \n2 masks per person a week. They are sold ONLY at the pharmacy, because they already have system to make sure people aren\'t perscribed medication repeatedly. Simply put, they punch in your national ID number, and they can see if you\'ve bought your ration of your masks for the week. You also have to be there in person, unless you\'re buying masks for kids 10 years or younger, or 80 or older person that you live with. Even then, it has to be your day. For example, I was born in 19x2. This means my day is Tuesday. I can buy two on Tuesday only. My son was born 2012. I can bring an official document that proves that we live together. Then I can buy 4, including 2 for my son. My wife can buy 4 on another day of the week (Monday) because she was born in 19x1, and my younger son was born in 2016 (1,6 on Monday, 2,7 on Tuesday, etc.). I will be stopping by my local pharmacy to pick up 4 masks for the kids tomorrow. This is the first week of the policy and I\'m sure there will be confusion everywhere, but I think it\'s a reasonable plan. I personally don\'t think the masks I already have are inadequate, but you don\'t know how long this CORVID-19 will last so I\'d like to buy them while I can.  \n  \nAll in all, our life has gotten much more unconfortable, but as people do, we\'ve gotten used to it. We try to watch the news on TV but turn them off pretty quickly because it makes everyone sad. I do keep up with the news online for Korea and around the world. Everyone around me agrees that if it wasn\'t for that cult, we\'d be in much better condition as a whole. We start fuming and cursing whenever the cult comes up in our conversation, and half-jokingly ask people around us to repeat the phrase, "FUCK Lee Man Hwee". He\'s the head of the cult, and "obviously" you won\'t be able to say so if you\'re part of the cult. Probably not true, but got to entertain ourselves somehow.\n\nEdit: I\'m adding small bits here and there to the text to mention any additional things that comes to mind.'
b'Finding a job without a global epidemic is hard enough, this thing is prob gonna screw up my job search even worse. Companies are gonna put hiring on hold, people work from home, and I\xe2\x80\x99m prob gonna be out of work for a lot longer. \n\nReally sucks, I bet the economy is gonna tank especially if this thing starts spreading exponentially. Whole cities and countries going into quarantine. Not a good time to be out of work.'
b'I started reading The Stand by Stephen King because I want to keep my anxiety at a keening pitch.'
b'I live in North Texas & I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like anyone I know, personally, actually understands what is going on. \n\nToday on my Facebook feed, these are things I saw (all by different people in my area):\n\n1. The flu is worse, there\xe2\x80\x99s only been 164 infections in the US per the CDC (posted by a local MD at our hospital & shared a couple hundred times by his patients & coworkers)\n\n2. People die of heart disease every day, people are dying of cancer...no one cares about that but you all want to panic over this over hyped virus \xf0\x9f\x99\x84\n\n3. In America, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to call into work if they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well anyway, so who cares, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of canceling big events \n\n4. (After posting how thrilled I was about SXSW) (random commenter) \xe2\x80\x9cWell you\xe2\x80\x99re a genius aren\xe2\x80\x99t you! You let the media tell you everything! I bet you don\xe2\x80\x99t even leave your house during flu season!!\xe2\x80\x9d *side note*: I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch the news & I literally just said i was glad they had canceled SXSW...\n\n5. I posted some compiled stats, was told I was wrong according to the CDC, proved myself correct with sources & was then told I was \xe2\x80\x9cfear mongering\xe2\x80\x9d & \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s okay if people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what you believe.\xe2\x80\x9d   *...it\xe2\x80\x99s not a belief though, it\xe2\x80\x99s scientific fact...but okay*\n\n6. ThE fLu Is WoRsE (RN x 2)\n\nThis. Was. Just. Today. \n\nNo one takes it seriously, no one is willing to take ANY extra precautions to protect themselves, so they especially don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone else. Even medical staff thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had like two counties in our state test people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared that if someone I love catches this, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to receive the care they need, because where I live, this has nothing to do with science & is 100% a partisan issue.'
b'What is the deal with newspapers paywalling coronavirus info? Since some science journals have unlocked their articles concerning coronavirus, I feel like journals should do so too, just to keep the public informed and reduce panic. Is anyone interested in petitioning someone like the NYT to make their coronavirus articles free?'
b'I\'ve been noticing quite a few posts by (understandably) confused Americans who are wondering why people on this sub are "panicking" about coronavirus if it "only kills the elderly/compromised" and saying that we are "misinformed." I realize that a lot of folks are new to this sub so I wanted to give this quick PSA:\n\n**There is a difference between individual risk and systemic risk. Government messaging tends to focus on the former. This sub tends to focus on the latter.**\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThis is a new virus with a lot of moving parts and a lot of unknowns. Sure, all data points currently point to high survival/recovery rates for young, healthy individuals. **No sane person on this sub is disputing this.** The issue that a lot of us are trying to underscore is that, regardless of the effect that the virus will have on you *personally*, it has the potential to create real issues for healthcare systems which are not designed to handle a surge of hospitalizations/ICU patients. And even more to the point, once that system hits a breaking point, all bets are off.\n\n[This is already happening in Italy as I type this.](https://twitter.com/RachelDonadio/status/1236760190592192514)\n\nThis is why they, like China, [have decided to lockdown 16 million people.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/08/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-europe-intl/index.html)\n\nAgain, I don\'t think any sane person on this sub thinks people should "panic" in the capital P sense of the word. I certainly don\'t want anyone to panic. But it *is* important for the general population to start looking beyond how this virus will affect them individually to see the greater issues involved.\n\nWe are all in this together.  And simply dismissing any article that attempts to highlight systemic risk as "fearmongering" or "misinformation" isn\'t helping. Systemic risks are scary. We get it. But being aware of them is important because it allows each of us to make different daily choices to keep ourselves and those we love safe.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n**Edit**: Just got a DM asking why the government isn\'t saying what I\'m saying if this is "such a big deal." The answer is simple. **Dealing with individual risks is the responsibility of the citizens. Dealing with systemic risk is the responsibility of the government.** At least in theory. This is why elections matter. This is also why journalism matters. It is up to journalists to ask hard questions about how the government is navigating systemic risk. And it is up to the citizens to hold their governments accountable when those answers fall short.'
b'Maybe I\'m dumb but how do you filter posts with a specific flair? The "World", "USA", "Good News" and all are non-clickable =/'
b"I'm not panicking, I'm pissed I have to do all this by myself since the government is showing its incompetence"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a student at Yale School of Drama and the university has cancelled all gatherings over 100 people. It puts my school in an interesting position with about ten theatre productions left of the school year. For now they\xe2\x80\x99re limiting audience capacity to 100 but I feel like they\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually cancel all productions. \n\nGraduation is also coming up, which I am assuming will be cancelled. Devastating for so many, but important to prevent families from traveling.'
b"I'm a doctor in Italy, not in the red zone. I have university mates in the middle of the crisis. They are working with insane shifts, I've heard a collegue who had been working from 40 hours no stop. One of them is in the Bergamo hospital from 10 days and can't get out.\nThis is terrifying. We are going to pay an enormous amount of lives. China basically stopped at 3000 deaths, with a total shut down, in a region that has the same number of people than italy.\nWe're not going to do that, and this would cost us even more deaths."
b'The theme parks (Disney, Universal, etc.) need to close.  It\xe2\x80\x99s sick that they would stay open when so any other gatherings with far fewer people are shutting down, and their target audience is children, who can carry the disease without knowing, and who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to practice good hygiene.  It feels really convenient that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any news of park workers being sick\xe2\x80\x94except in Paris, where they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to keep Disney open, anyway.'

I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an immuno-compromised step daughter with infant twins that we are supposed to visit after they get back. Trying to figure out the best way to keep them safe, which means no visit.'

b'Had an email addressed to my husband (to my email adress) from Cathay Pacific cancelling our flight from NZ to Ireland via Hong Kong. My name was not included in the email. Tonight I got a text saying our flight is via LAX instead.\n\nScam or legit? There was nothing phishing included like requests for cc info etc.  I Forwarded the cancellation email to our travel agent who has not replied. We are meant to leave early next month.\n\nTBH I have multiple concerns. Travel right now seems like a bad idea and America seems likely to blow up, ruling it out as a potential transit stop. Plus we need visas to travel through the States which doesnt help.\n\nFlight Centre the last time we spoke to them advised us to "sit tight" and see what happens. Radio silence from FC now tho.... I\'m  thinking flight Centre looking out for Flight Centre.\n\nEdit: email update from Cathay Pacific: flight now AKL to HKG to ZRH to DUB. Not via LAX at all (text said LX and I misread it and jumped to LAX conclusions)\n\nWe are not panicked people as a rule, have been fairly calm re coronavirus (not hoarding loo roll, or prepping for end time) Its really hard to know what to do about travel tho....'

b'I also wanted to share my observations  from being out in public these past few days. I live in Westchester County, an affluent suburb of New York City. For the last week we have seen (Westchester alone) the cases of this virus jump from 1-100 people in a week (due to our representatives fighting for tests). I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed many people doing due diligence when it comes to hand hygiene. I was on line at the atm. No one use the hand sanitizer that was available at the door. People were scratching their faces. At a yoga class where we used props, balls and weights, the teacher made a point to wipe down mats but didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother with balls or weights. Right after we left the class another group came in and immediately took balls and weights that were just used and not sanitised.  \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.

b"I'm in Berlin. I feel like I'm being overly paranoid. I was made fun of sanitising my hands and was told I was too crazy. Seems like Germany is going to be the second Italy anytime soon but majority of the people here are so chill though hamster purchases can be spotted at some supermarkets. Personal hygiene wise, people couldn't care less.."
b'Someone in r/travel was asking about a trip to NYC. I told them to delay it if possible, and if not possible, to disinfect their luggage with Lysol spray when they get back and to stock up on groceries before the trip so they can go straight from work to home for two weeks after their return. I got downvoted and accused of fear mongering. We are so fucked. My coworkers and patients won\xe2\x80\x99t even wash their hands after literally wiping snot off their nose. It\xe2\x80\x99s so selfish.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a student at Columbia University, and we just had classes canceled Monday and Tuesday, and classes changed to online streams after that due to a student being exposed to coronavirus and coming back to campus.

b'I keep hearing people say \xe2\x80\x9cPurell is anti-bacterial, so it won\xe2\x80\x99t kill corona virus.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought hand sanitizers will kill almost all germs (viruses included). Am I wrong?'
b'Is there any logical way to predict where we (USA) are going to be in a few months time if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t testing like we should be? Will we ever have a good picture of how many people are infected? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the models showing how exponential growth can be calculated to predict how many cases we will have in a few months but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how that can be predicted if we have no idea how many people are truly infected at a given time.

I have high bp, and know that's kind of a problem with Covid.\n\nMy wife's folks came over today, visited with us, gave the kids a big old hug...then proceeded to tell us both (grandma to my wife) that we are making a mistake and grandpa (to me) about how this is eerily reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the homosexual community in the 80s-90s.

I brought this up to my boss via email, and we had an in-person talk today. Basically my boss said I should not panic, it's not gonna be a big deal, etc. I state that I'm not worried about myself, but rather my elderly parents catching the virus when I go back. The risk is low but I'd rather not take it. My boss tells me to calm down and think over it, if I want to I can book a flight and leave early. Talked to US Embassy in Germany, they don't really have any answers for me.\n\nSorry if this is not the right subreddit but should I just go early?

b'Hi all, Question. My spouse & I have air travel planned next week to attend a festival in a city where there are currently NO coronavirus cases.\n\nThere are cases in our area. From a moral standpoint, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spread the virus if I am a carrier.  Also, If I do contract it from community spread at home, I would want to be quarantined at home, not in a city across the country. \n\nWe are not afraid of getting sick - we are healthy and in our late 20s - but we are afraid of the potential of being grounded in that city for an extended period of time. \n\nQuestions:\n(1) If I needed to be quarantined in another city, I would be SOL as far as cost coverage, right? I assume I would not be moved to a military base for recovery like the cruise ship passengers. Unless my condition required hospitalization, I would need to pay out of pocket for hotel costs. Private health insurance, home insurance, umbrella insurance would not cover that. Is this right? \n\n(2) We are concerned about the possibility of not being able to return home easily. While flights probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be grounded, is it possible that certain airports will not accept flights if the virus is bad enough in that city? \n\nWe really wanted to go on this trip but we are wondering if the responsible thing to do - from a financial and time perspective - would be to skip it, since it seems like shit is hitting the fan fast.

Would it actually be in my best interest as a young, healthy adult to get infected as early on in the course of the outbreak as possible? (also assuming I'm successful in not infecting anyone else)\n\n[https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/](https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/)\n\nHear me out. According to epidemiologist Trevor Bedford, the virus mutates at an average rate of once per two weeks. The transmission rate is roughly once per week from incubation to transmission to the next host, so you can think of the virus gaining a new point mutation between every two infections on average. The first case sequenced in the US on Jan 15 was found to be the ancestor of another case sent in on Feb 28, with 3 new point mutations in between. So my other question is: over time, will the mutations that increase the virus' hardiness/destructiveness be selected for? Right now the odds of the virus killing a young, healthy person like myself are very low, so if I were to get infected early, take all precautions, quarantine myself etc. until I've recovered and gained antibodies/immunity, would I most likely be immune to potentially more dangerous strains that emerge in the future? Does the immunity just last until the virus mutates in the epitope region? How quickly is this thing evolving compared to other recent epidemic viruses?"

They do not even know the exact name of the virus. Almost nobody.\n\nThey also say, when I tell them my arguments, "what should we do? Should we stay home all the time". I never said something like that. I tell them to be onlu more cautious and wash their hands better.\n\nAnd this are only two examples of such discussions.\n\nI do not understand such an behavior. They only thing about themselfs. Such an behavior is egoistic and irresponsable. One could transport the virus to someone loved. This person could be responsible for the death of other people. I know that this is the worst case. You could be the one who let other persons have a really hard time in hospitals.\n\nThey let me stay in discussion like i am overacting or overreacting. But I think they are the real morons when they laugh at people who take also real care on others.\n\nThis are people who almost never stop to speak to others and give advice over advice. They spread ignorance, disinformation, lies and could give other people a dalse sense of the situation.

b'Just today, my school has declared that for the next 2 weeks, it will be virtual school.'
b"Question: two classmates are traveling to another country this weekend, and I want to join them; but I'm not sure that's responsible given that there was already a confirmed case of Covid19 at our university. Should I stay or should I go?\n\nFor context: we're in Spain and the confirmed corona case was a staff member of our uni, not a teacher or student. This was reported about a week ago, and no new cases have been confirmed by the university. \nHowever I'm a bit skeptical and not sure why classes aren't cancelled yet, since many businesses are telling their employees to work from home already. Of course with this mindset and knowing I could potentially be infected already, going to like 4 cities across Europe doesn't sound like the best idea... am I overreacting?"
b"Still don't understand how March Madness or these conference tournaments are not being played without fans. Just imagine the mess this is going to create if one person tests positive in the first round.

b'Gosh, a local news radio show in Florida, a guy was talking about a Florida Department of Health presentation tomorrow before our county commission. The host said the media is hyping the virus and your more likely to die from the flu. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the media is hyping like they do about everything, but doing the opposite is equally bad... The guest at least said that the health department person should know what was going on so listen to them, but wow it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy to hear local media in Florida, less then 80 miles from a confirmed case, saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal and overhyped.'
b"Is it TRUE that (COVID-19) stops from spreading in Summer ? Or it's just another lie !!"
b"i have a (maybe stupid) question:\n\nif for a moment we take the official numbers as reasonable and close to reality we have about 112,000 infections with about 45,000 active cases and 63,000 recoveries. so the number of recoveries has overtaken the number of active cases. doesn't that mean that we would normally never have more than 45,000 (or rather less) active cases in the future since the recoveries outpace the new infections?"
b"Questions to people in the UK. Excuse my English.\n\nI just read a post on Facebook about the Corona virus in the UK by a Vietnamese (my country) woman who is living in London. She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously, they still think this is just a normal flu, people still hanging around without a mask. She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus. It's very hard to buy a mask too, the price is getting higher. And if you have the symptoms of the virus, u call 111, but if you don't have all the symptoms (fever, cough, pneumonia) then the doctor won't come to test you. Her Vietnamese friend had to pretend that her symptoms were very serious (coughing on the phone etc..) and she get tested, but the result came after 3 days (!!!). If the result is positive then you have to self quarantined at home, there would be a phone call everyday but nothing more, you gonna be okay anyway. The person with the virus cannot go to the hospital unless it's very serious because they are afraid that they will spread it to other doctors and patients.\n\nIs that all true? Well you can't believe everything on social media so I'm here to ask. Hope to get a honest answer. Thank you"
b'Question- when you get sick how long till you are deemed recovered?'
b'My sister came home yesterday from work saying that one of her coworkers felt sick and was saying she might have the virus. She works at a pizza place and my husband and I were pissed because I stopped by to grab a free pizza from her and her coworker was there. We asked her to tell her manager but my husband thinks we should maybe call the CDC? What are we supposed to do in this situation? There\xe2\x80\x99s 12 potential cases in my area right now so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why someone would be joking about having it. Also my grandparents came over yesterday so we were kind of freaking out. Why are people so stupid and inconsiderate?'

b'Does anyone know of a chart or data set that actually shows the breakdown by age of how many people are hospitalized, or killed? \n\nAll I can seem to find is the same old charts from weeks ago showing .2% death rate for 10 - 40 year olds.  I wonder if this is even accurate anymore and want to see absolute real numbers of death rate and hospitalization rate.  Seems suspicious that this is so hard to find anywhere.'
b"My parents came back from Ecuador 3 weeks ago and have developed a sickness which they have only dismissed as the common cold. All they've told me is they don't have the coronavirus symptoms instead. They don't believe they are at risk for coronavirus at all. Am I crazy to think they should get tested?"
b"Hi guys,  \n\n\nI've got an unusual question. I'm a volunteer at the animal shelter in Warsaw. I'm wondering if there is anyone on Reddit, who deals with the same stuff in Italy, France, Germany or other countries, where people already started to panic.\n\nMaybe some volunteers will notice my comment - if not, do you know where I should ask? I'm new here. Or maybe you have some friends who help at shelters and you can ask? I've got three questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Do adoptions still take place or is it close to zero now?\n2. 2. Have people started to abandon their pets more frequently in this situation?\n3. 3. How do you make sure you don't get infected when you're where? Do you have any procedures?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need to know it, because here, in Poland, people don't care about the situation and are not aware of the fact that it will strike us with great power. We seem not to have any procedures for this case and I can't imagine just leaving those poor dogs and cats with no support.\n\nThank you!"

b"This article is a bit old for today, but still.\n\n When the information on coronavirus outbreak in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan was officially confirmed, social networks were filled with messages from schoolers, their parents and school teachers. Turned out that local schools had strict rules regarding school uniforms, the color of medical masks that can be worn in school in case of an epidemy was also limited by said rulkes to plain white only.  \n\n\n\\>The problem of the shortage of medical masks in the country has not yet been solved; will it be allowed to wear a pale pink mask at school if the parents did not find a white mask? This issue was submitted to the school board and it was decided to make an indulgence. Was there a need for such a discussion? Now you can wear colored masks.  \n\n\n\\>It was difficult to find medical masks to supply them with a child. The next day, he said that masks of any color other than white were against the school rules. It could be considered a rebellion against school rules, but plain whire masks are still nowhere to be found. Fortunately, in the first-aid post provided the child with a mask of white color, so the problem was solved.  \n\n\n\\>The child had to ignore the school rule against wearing masks that are not white, yet at the same time those people who simply coughed without a mask can be detained in the subway.  \n\n\n\\>It's understandable when we don't allow kids to wear expensive or flashy clothes to school to not attract too much attention, but what about imposing restrictions on the color of the mask at such situation? I believe the school will have to keep responsibility if someone gets infected because of this.  \n\n\n\\>In the end, on February 23, the Kumamoto City Department of Education had to make an official statement in which educational institutions were advised: during the period of infection, schools should not limit the color of masks worn by students.  \n\n\nSources:  \n[https://9post.tv/284983](https://9post.tv/284983)  \n[https://j-cast.com/trend/2020/02/25](https://j-cast.com/trend/2020/02/25)380517.html"

b"Is it possible that this virus has a delayed effect like HIV/AIDS? Could we hear that coronavirus 'survivors' are dying from the virus in a year? Or is this virus unlikely to cause any concern after its gone?"
b'I keep seeing this meme get shared on Facebook with blatant misinformation in it:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/qJmCLBl'
b"PSA: Check out resources offered by your library/school - they might include free access to different news articles and other stuff to keep you occupied/updated. For example, the Toronto Public Library offers a free 3-day pass to the New York Times website that you can renew as many times as you want. McGill offers access to PressReader, where I found the Toronto Star, the Wall Street Journal, Globe and Mail, and National Post. They both offer access to Kanopy, where you can find a lot of cool documentaries and lectures! I've noticed that a lot of my fellow Torontonians/students don't know about these features, but I'm pretty sure they're fairly common if you live in a big city/attend a big university"
b'I presume nobody would know the answer to this, but for example, I live like half a block from a city park that has a big field and a playground. I see people mentioning that they get to go out for walks and things during a quarantine, so I\'ve been hanging my hope on the belief that it would "comply" with any quarantine for us to still take our kids to the park, so we are not trapped inside all day with them. This is the US and I don\'t know if we\'ll ever actually do anything to quarantine people... but I guess hypothetically, would that be "ok" generally, or are you "supposed" to literally stay in your house as much as possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could see it being "ok" because it\'s outside and spread out, but obviously, if everyone is doing that, especially the kids, they\'d just be transmitting everything between themselves and then taking it home for their parents.'
b'Guys im having sore throat ,runny nose and sneezing but i have no fever \nCould i possibly have ncov?'

b'So ... I seem to have most of the symptoms including a cough (but it is "wet" due to acute bronchitis) ... plus I have had diarrhea over the past 2 days. However ... no fever. And other then an international flight and a pass through Heathrow, have not been in any red flag zones.\nAny opinions?'
b"This image shows how European countries (ignoring Italy which is a special case) are totally failing at fighting COVID-19.\n\nDespite a whole one month's head start, they are almost all about to overtake Hong Kong in terms of cases per head of population:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Qew8zee.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qew8zee.png)\n\nGraphic made with this site:\n\n[http://www.casualhacker.net/covid19-spread/growth.html](http://www.casualhacker.net/covid19-spread/growth.html)\n\nPlease spread far and wide to your media and your social media, this will help them understand as most media are totally clueless on this virus.\n\nBig action is needed now by governments! Stop all large gatherings, close schools and universities, issue masks, lock down regions with the biggest clusters, force companies to offer remote working if they can. Go to war with virus instead of 'waiting for summer' - there is no evidence this virus will just disappear then, nor is there evidence that there will suddenly be a critical care bed for everyone who needs one then. Governments must go to war with the virus NOW and not delay."
b'United States infection and death numbers are probably underestimated due to a lack of medical care. Many Americans will not go to the hospital because they cannot afford to pay. If you complicate that with the possibility of being quarantined and receiving death threats from panicked  Americans, it becomes a recipe for avoiding hospitals as long as possible.'
b'When is Idaho going to report numbers? If anyone believes its zero, their only fooling themselves. Why have we had 6 suspected cases for over a week with no updates and 4 in quarantine at BSU and no confirmation or otherwise.... why is our state not reporting? Are we just not testing? People are getting very concerned!'
b"Any idea why Germany hasn't had any deaths yet? Are they treating severe patients differently? This would be very helpful information. I am very surprised there is so little information available about this."

b'Thank you for sharing. This is insightful for some of us that are a month or two behind.'
b"Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.  The president is more concerned about controlling the information and making everything seem like it's fine instead of trying to protect Americans at all costs.\n\nBtw I love how they told us all masks wouldn't do anything to help."
b'This is really interesting thanks so much for sharing. What strikes me, particularly, is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the UK being anywhere near this organised and disciplined.'
b"It looks like South Korea may very well be winning the fight against the virus.  Your daily new cases has dropped from 272 to 165 (the lowest in 2 weeks).

b'Thank you for sharing your experience. I appreciate that you took the time to write about it and share it with us.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little worrying elsewhere imagining that more of us may find ourselves in a similar situation soon.\n\nAt least we\xe2\x80\x99ll all know we\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in our efforts and difficulties. There\xe2\x80\x99s an irony in feeling together in staying apart.\n\nI hope that treatments for serious cases will gradually improve as we learn more about this disease, and the rate of transmission will slow partially because we\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to contain it, and eventually a good portion of the population may recover from it and be immune and unable to catch or spread the same version again. \n\nIf we can try to slow the rate of spread enough to keep up with treating the most serious cases and try to isolate the most vulnerable from getting it until that time, then things may work out pretty well.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but we do know that this probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be forever, and life will move forward eventually.'

b'Very insightful, thanks for sharing. It shows how you guys are taking a bottoms up cultural approach to combating the virus (eg no mask, no elevator) and the text messaging system. It also shows how absolutely unprepared Western countries are. \n\nIf President Moon had also taken a firmer approach once the virus had spread, you guys would be much better off too.'

b"Wow. I retired early and left Korea late last year after 22 years of living there. I can visualize all of this so easily and vividly.

b'What do you think will happen to your neighbours on the other side of the DMZ? Do you worry that due to their status as the hermit kingdom that COVID-19 could be the downfall of the DPRK (North Korea) as they\xe2\x80\x99ll most likely refuse help from the outside world therefore leading to the deaths of millions of people with, only the worthy surviving.'

b'As soon as this became a story I had to go back and reread it. Still think the first half of that book is one of the greatest pieces of storytelling ever'
b'The point is not that this is a super dangerous disease for each individual, in particular if you\'re young and healthy. And this is the panicky feeling I get from some.\n\nThe point is that this disease could easily overwhelm our health care systems which would increase the all cause mortality. If the hospital is over capacity, you can\'t deal with a stroke as efficiently as you would otherwise...\n\nAnd the second point is something the "it\'s just the flu" crowd can\'t see.\n\nYes, with appropriate care only a very small percentage of sick people will die from it but if this new disease spreads too quickly, appropriate care won\'t be possible.'

b"I've been warning my family since January, and I keep hearing just relax it's not that bad. I don't really say anything else about it that much to them, I just keep informing myself and keeping up to date with current events. I was always someone who barely checked the news, but now I've been checking it everyday because of how swiftly things are changing. I could care less about politics right now, when we are headed into an economic and medical disaster that we haven't seen in a hundred years. That's just my opinion.

b'I\'ve never understood this whole "the flu is worse" like ok yh alot of people do die of the flu a year but the flue has been around for alot longer and we know what to expect. Coronavirus on the other hand is a new disease and no one knows shit about it we\'re still researching the coronavirus to see just how bad it is. Not to mention we have a vaccine for the flu and for the coronavirus a vaccine is atleast a year away if not longer. Lastly you just need to look at how fast coronavirus is spreading every day and most research points to the coronavirus having a higher death rate then the flu. \nNot to mention with more and more people getting infected everyday we could potentially see a massive increase in the death rate within the next few weeks'
b'I am in shock about how people are not taking this seriously.  Just look at Northern Italy right now, what makes anyone think that can\xe2\x80\x99t/won\xe2\x80\x99t happen in our communities?!  I have wasted my breath for the last two weeks trying to convince my 70 year old mother and father in law not to travel on Tuesday (to Las Vegas for their largest trade show, CONEXPO which isn\xe2\x80\x99t cancelled, a different rant.) Even after the CDC guidance that came out Friday, they are still unconvinced.   I\xe2\x80\x99m beside myself.'
b'Do yourself a favor and stay off Facebook. I got off a few years ago and it has been great for my mental health.'
b"I am just amazed that we've come to this point in science denial, that a person catches grief for quoting the CDC! I am profoundly disappointed in the politicians that knowingly perpetuate this (and yes the bar is LOW). It is a complete abdication of 'working for the people'. Disgusting."
b"I've encountered the same types of people. I had a coworker make fun of me for preparing(buying extra food and cleaning stuff). But at the same time I convinced another coworker to start prepping as well!"
b"I don't know if they will. At least not right away. Their revenue is probably going up during this period. When people NEED news to survive, they will be willing to pay for it.

b'Yale undergrad here. Apparently professors have been trained in using remote videoconference software \xe2\x80\x9cjust in case\xe2\x80\x9d classes are cancelled after spring break.

b'All I can say is that I salute you and your friends for being the brave fighters against Coronavirus in Italy, good luck and take care.\n\nWhen the government don\xe2\x80\x99t act, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the people to save themselves, I recommend you to recruit volunteers early, give basic training, so they can help when time comes.'
b"I'm an hour from DW and have been complaining about this daily. They put out a press release saying they'd be open and train staff accordingly but they already are super hygienic.

b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of unconfirmed cases where people don\xe2\x80\x99t even get tested cause they\xe2\x80\x99re exhibiting mild symptoms but are infected. If you count these, it lowers the death rate.'
b'this is wrong. look up proper epidemiology math. \n\n*Case fatality rate, also called case fatality ratio, in epidemiology, the proportion of people who die from a specified disease among all individuals diagnosed with the disease over a certain period of time.*\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why you came up with your own equation...to scare? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the correct way to formulate a mortality rate. We need to stop looking for ways to feel hopeless. This is stupid. The mortality rate is somewhere around 3%, per literally everyone calculating it everywhere BUT your comment.'

b'Whenever you ask this question, the answer will be, "tomorrow" or "next week" it seems. Too much conflicting info. We\'ll only know when and if it actually happens.'
b"Literally nobody knows. The CDC is keeping a very tight lid on that information, while Trump says we already have two million tests that don't exist.\n\nSome local governors are announcing their capacity.

b"If you booked via a travel agent and not directly with the airline, its possible that a different email address and/or contact numbers have been entered into the airline's systems.  This looks legit and too specific to be scam.  Its best to seek advice from your travel agent.\n\nNote that it is possible to re-route you going to the opposite way, so instead of flying east (via HKG), they are routing you west via some other hub or direct from LAX."

b'Hi, I graduated from Columbia in 2018. It\xe2\x80\x99s always a pleasure for me to come across another fellow lion. First of all, please allow me to express my sympathy. Now, I am really wondering about this: A lot of 300-people-enrolled classes usually have on-site finals. What will happen to these finals? Also, will on-campus housing shut down? I know that a lot of dorm are ill-designed for a pandemic. They are by nature diamond princess without a starboard. \nOnce again, I am very sorry that you are going through this. Any answers you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.'
b"From what I understand, corona is an enveloped virus, which can be destroyed with alcohol. Non enveloped viruses such as norovirus, aren't susceptible to alcohol as a disinfectant. That being said, handwashing trumps hand sanitizer."
b"SciShow youtube said the virus envelope is fat based so soap really tears it apart. the alcohol in sanitize would work also.\n\nJust like hand washing when you use a sanitizer it has to stay wet while you're 'lathering' it around for a minimum of 20 seconds for clinical effect. Smaller amounts will still dry you out and therefore feel effective but it takes 20 seconds so don't skimp."
b'Yes, she is *much* more at risk than the average person. Her immune system is less powerful both because of the disease and the biologic.\n\n [https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/at-risk-groups.html](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/at-risk-groups.html) \n\nTo be frank, your wife should probably self-isolate the moment cases are reported in your area, and you guys should be prepared to continue to do so for a significant period of time.\n\nWith her condition you guys cannot be too careful with your sanitization and cleaning routines. The less people you are exposed to the better. The less public locations you are exposed to, the better.'
b"Speaking from one of the hospitals in the Seattle area, we do not allow visitors for suspected and confirmed Covid patients. The hospitals in this area also have the same policy. One of my nightmares is that my parents get it, are hospitalized, and I wouldn't be able to see them again."
b"If I'm able/allowed to visit, absolutely. I'll wash my hands thoroughly before & after, but I'm not in a high-risk category; I'm not very worried about myself. And I know I can help my parents de-stress significantly, which will help them recover.\n\nEdit: A lot of it would depend on circumstances, though. Some folks don't have good/close relationships with their parents, some aren't able to travel to where their parents would be, some folks are at higher risk or live with folks at higher risk & it may not be worth the risk for them, etc. I wouldn't judge folks who chose differently than me; this is just *my* answer.\n\nSecond edit: Also for the record, everyone should always wash their hands before & after any hospital visit. Before, for the sake of the folks being treated there, and after, for your own sake & those around you at home."
b"Several Japanese medical personnel that interacted with the Diamond Princess are coming up positive sometime later, and these are people versed in infection control PPE usage.\n\n\nBut again this is your loved ones your family, you can't just turn your back at a time of need. \n\n\nThat's a very good question"
b"My parents? Lol no. If they wanted sympathy on their death beds they probably shouldn't have put their cigarettes out on my chest.\n\nBut let's say your relationship with your parents is normal. What good is visiting them going to do? They will be in isolation. It's not like you can go in and talk to them without wearing full PPE. You can maybe tap on their window and wave or something, but it's probably better to just Skype with them if they aren't intubated."
b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about him prior to this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve gained a ton of respect for him with how he\xe2\x80\x99s handling this.'
b'You are the parents and you make the decisions. Sometimes you make mistakes as a parent, but I know your heart is in the right place when you made this decision in trying to protect your family and others, so even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good mistake. Your lives and your kids lives can\xe2\x80\x99t be replaced, schoolwork can. I say you made the right call as we wait to see what will happen. They can always make up the work or do summer school if need be. Good luck.'
b"Trust me. Don't believe 'the virus just fetal to elders' kind of bullshit. I from China, i know this virus can even kill infants. Cases already been reported in my country. But i don't know why other country don't report that. Be safe"

b"The u.s. is just starting to break out cases. We are not testing on purpose to keep our numbers low but that won't last forever. I think you and your spouse will be vindicated in the next month. The kids can always make up their learning."
b'It is a really tough call.  My wife and I are also in Oregon.  We talked tonight and were torn on sending the kids to school tomorrow.  We decided to keep them home.  I already work from home so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep them off screens and have them do Kahn Academy, books, and documentaries.  It is only a two day week for parent teacher conferences.  I think a combination of the lack of testing and the middle school being kept open in Hillsboro was what pushed me over the edge.  We aren\xe2\x80\x99t that worried but both kids took turns being sick last week and now I have the sore throat and cough my oldest did.  Pretty sure my oldest had RSV and not Covid but staying home seems like the safer move for everyone.'
b'I just bought a little extra of what i normally buy in case my household is quarantined or supplies become limited because of factories closing or limited importing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have major stockpiles, but just for example, an extra package of paper towels instead of just the one i normally keep. A little extra cleaning supplies, toiletries, food that i would eat anyway, meds i use, dog food.\n\nI have the ability to keep my house running just as before for at least a full month or so without shopping. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for long term power or water outages because so far that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an issue in even the hardest hit places.\n\nThe plan is to keep this extra safety barrier up for a year or so, i guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll know if it gets eradicated sooner. I think it will come back hard in the fall.'
b'Disinfectant with 75% or more ethanol or alcohol with a high alcohol content such as spiritus. \nThese disinfectants can be used not only for disinfecting hands, but also for wiping places where everyone can touch, such as doorknobs and light switches.\nSpiritus should be diluted with purified water to 75% alcohol.'

b"We are doing fine with our testing, a lot better than other European countries, I hope you're not panic buying. Products are being taken away from those who seriously need them because of this mass panic."
b'It has to do with your immune system & your general health, since if you develop severe symptoms your breathing will be impacted and your general health dictates how well you can manage that/how likely you are to develop other complications from it.'
b'I am very sorry. The odds of you not dying are very good, but I very much hope that you and all of your loved ones remain healthy. I wish that for all of the people of this country that shall not be named. ;)'
b"I'm so sorry you are stuck in that situation :(  Best you can do is stay home as much as possible and wash your hands very often!  Best of luck!"
b'Very sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re going through this. Sending virtual hugs (no germs!) from an Internet stranger.'
b"Swine flu broke out in Mexico in April and spread through the United States by way of Texas and California. It came at the end of flu season and wasn't as destructive as it could have been thanks to a warm summer and it mutating to a less deadly strain. \n\nCorona broke out in China in December in the middle of winter. Spread way too fast into Europe and Asia. We have to survive another 2 months before warmer weather can slow down the outbreak. Also, the mortality rate is insanely high (3%) in the over 60 demographic. That's terrifying when you consider the flu is like .1%"
b'Oh, millions of people. Especially in the United States.'
b"What's essential service?  Police,  fire, emt, hospitals sure.  \n\nHow about truckers,  bringing food all over the country? Had stations?  The military?  Postal service?   Supermarkets?  Veterinarians?  Utility and sanitation?  Plumbers and electricians?   We're not going to let family members visit loved ones in hospitals,  hospice,  etc?   \n\nI hear what you're saying,  I just don't see how we implement it."
b"It's so easy to say it, but now try to implement."
b'Better safe than sorry.'
b"Tbh it's no wonder it's spreading so much given how the NHS are responding.\n\nMe and my partner just got back from Amsterdam, now he's got a temperature, cough and headache. Called 111 and was told by someone at PHE that I needed to speak to someone from 111 and get a test organised as people have been coming back from there with cases. Get through to 111 guy who basically says they can't do anything unless you've been to one of the countries on their list. Which is ridiculous if you've been through any airport as you have more than likely been close to someone who HAS been to one of those places. There's definitely way more cases than they think there are if they're flat out ignoring anyone who hasn't been to Italy Iran China or South Korea."
b"How do you get in contact with someone who has been diagnosed, if they don't diagnose anyone?"
b'With proper protection, infection is preventable. After the first devastating wave, no doctor get infected in Wuhan. So I guess dentist well be fine if they use proper protection. However for the safety concerns, most dental clinics in China is still close waiting for further notice.'
b"From what I've read (afraid I don't have links handy), a lot of it is exhaustion or dehydration; I know workers in China at least knew they were short on protective gear and would avoid drinking (which would require changing out their gear) as long as they could, sometimes too long. And I've seen at least one person in Italy talking about working 40-hr shifts, so exhaustion is definitely a factor. And the repeated exposure means they're very likely to get it eventually, though I don't know that it drives their immune system haywire. And when they do get it, because of the exhaustion and possible dehydration, some will get a bad case of it, and their healthcare systems are already overwhelmed so they can't get good care, so... it's a compounding issue."
b'Because if the economy fails he has no basis for his re-election'
b"Money. It's always money. He knows a recession will make it harder to win re-election."
b"We don't know yet. There's some reports of re-infection, but those could've been folks who just hadn't fully recovered from the initial infection. It also remains to be seen how much it mutates/how impactful those mutations are."
b'Why get worried about it?  i accept it as fact.'
b'Cultures differ. This disease might change the way people view the use of masks.\n\nThat said, there are concerns about shortages of masks for medical workers, and guidance on the use of masks seems to differ by country.\n\nYou probably should follow the recommendations from health experts and officials, and try not to worry about what other people think either way.'
b'Who could have known?'
b'Which island?\n\nMy island (Oahu) has about a million people and two positive tests. I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get a lot more and wish they\xe2\x80\x99d act now. But shit\xe2\x80\x99s going to explode. :/\n\nI wish you luck. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard living in an isolated place rn'
b'You can\xe2\x80\x99t report what you\xe2\x80\x99re not tracking.'
b'If I have 10 ICU beds in a hospital, and the average admitted CV patient takes up 21 days worth of ICU, then I can only treat 173 patients a year.  If all 173 show up on Monday, then 163 are fucked.'
b'All else equal, social distancing and quarantines should be expected to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby the rate of spread.\n\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t catch a disease if you\xe2\x80\x99re never near any source of it.\n\nAlthough the efforts so far haven\xe2\x80\x99t been effective in stopping the spread of the disease entirely, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a reason to give up. Slowing down the rate of spread gives us more time to prepare and ensure those who become seriously ill get proper treatment.'
b'You might find it helpful to read the WHO\xe2\x80\x99s COVID-19 FAQ and guidance [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)'
b'Wikipedia is a great place to start.  SARS had about 8,000 cases and 800 deaths.  From the time it started showing up in significant numbers it took about 3 months to reach this peak.  SARS was also easier to contain since it did not spread until people had a fever and even then there weren\xe2\x80\x99t droplets.  Anyway, this outbreak already has an order of magnitude more cases and almost five times the number of deaths and it is just getting started.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\xe2\x80\x9304_SARS_outbreak'

But we know how rapidly things can change so take it for what's it worth!"
b'Ask yourself how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel if one or more of your family members got sick and you were quarantined in the city. Do you have a good stock of food in the city? That\xe2\x80\x99s a LOT of roommates. Imagine being quarantined with them vs. having a yard and dogs (!!!) and family for support. You\xe2\x80\x99re not overthinking this.'
b'The only thing to fear is the lack of fear itself.'
b"Absolutely. The smartest thing would be to not have big events with lots of people close to each other. It will spread, reguardless of if it done intentionally or not. Trump is 73, Bernie is 78, Biden is 77. Not good ages for catching this, especially if they have any pre-existing conditions.\n\nI imagine no hand shakes, keep people 6+ ft away at times... Maybe we see secret service freak out and tackle someone for sneezing or coughing lol who knows. \n\nYou're right though, people who are famous/in positions of power have a really high chance of catching this."
b"Yea the dorm situation is not good for spreading an illness. However, neither is traveling through crowded airports to get home to you parents. I would not leave to avoid getting sick as getting home you very well may pick it up and then spread it to your parents. If your main concern is being stuck in Germany while sick but would rather be home, that's another thing. If you do come home, I would self quaratine for 14 days before visiting with friends and family and airports are hotspots. (especially if you're concerned about your parents getting sick.)\n\nYou're allowed to do whatever you want for personal reasons."
b'The Government should never be your role models'
b"We don't really know yet."
b'It might spread slower in warm weather. Australia and south America will show us in the coming weeks'
b"We don't know.\n\nTypically, but not always, respiratory viruses like coronavirus or the flu slow down in hotter more humid weather.\n\nIt's reasonable to think that's probably going to be the case now with this virus, but there's currently no direct evidence that it will happen."
b"We don't have data on Covid-19's longevity at temperature yet.\n\nBut similar viruses persist for days at 30C on various surfaces.\n\n [https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext)"
b"Currently experiments indicated the virus will be killed fast at temperature of 56 celsius.  \nThat's the only information about temperature which can be proved. \nHowever due to spread situation in Singapore  Thailand,  Malaysia.  it make people believe that when summer comes the virus maybe gone or at least not so aggressive \nMaybe the temperature is a factor,  maybe it's not about temperature but about the ultra violet ray. \nBut for now,  we could only say we don't know."
b'I think you need to inform all that someone associated with your school has is being tested and that once the test results are in you will no more. Keep everything about the person confidential. Always remember a good leader thinks about the whole and getting out ahead of this is probably best.'

b'Stock up on non perishables in the event both of you become quarantined.'
b"Not sure what the CDC or DoS' advice is, particularly for returning travelers from Italy. But really, he needs to self-isolate himself to his own room for 14 days. If he has his own bathing facilities excellent, if not he'll have to disinfect literally everything he touches or uses in the bathroom. But really the advice we're getting here in the UK is you basically need to seal him off; bring food to his door, run his errands. It's a big task, and not one I would do unless there wasn't an alternative for him - like his family home or whatever."
b'Los Angeles and the airport specifically are hubs of transmission. The best thing would probably be for your family to join you in Italy early and wear gloves and masks on the road. One flight instead of three. Flight availability may reduce at any moment too'
b"I would not play russian roulette with my personal/family life or my financials, and it's not going to get any better in the US either by March 13. That is only my personal opinion, but i can see it is a tough decision."
b'International travel from Italy to the US or vice versa has been banned.'
b"I think the deciding factor should be to keep the elderly in laws as safe as possible.  But on the other hand they will still end up catching it no matter what you do.  This RO is really high and America is failing miserably with their responses.  It's like the Americans just don't understand how serious this threatens our elderly.  I'm American and think the CDC,  the president,  and politicians both Democrat and Republican parties all failed equally."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not working for me either.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s not panic; the most likely scenario is some kind of tech issue.'
b"That's probably closer to accurate, yeah."
b"100%, what's currently reported probably isn't even half of the actual number. Remember this is exponential, especially if people don't take the right percautions like self quarantine."
b"Because the data we have now shows that cases start to appear exponentially. So while cases can be low now, they quickly start to stack up as time progresses. \n\nSo little is being done in many population centres, it seems that the prevalent hive mind is that this will all blow over. And if it doesn't then you face the crush of unprepared."
b'The CDC only reports cases they have directly confirmed. Most of the cases mentioned were performed by the individual states.'
b"I believe the CDC doesn't update their numbers over the weekend, and during the week they only post the one daily update at noon. So their current count doesn't include anything reported since noon Friday, until they update today in another ~30 minutes."
b'The John Hopkins site also just stopped reporting numbers... with no explanation about 40 mins ago.'
b"That's just one major event in one country.\n\nEveryday thousands are packing into arenas, night clubs, concert halls, churches, schools, mass transit, movie theatres, lecture halls, just to name a few. \n\nIf it truely has an R0 of 3, how you stopping it."
b'Japan seems to be under reporting and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the Olympics. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of money invested in it.  They should cancel.'

b'If you are offered a refund, I would probably just take it.'
b'I also have flight to Florida to visit 60+ relatives in less than two weeks. Almost all have underlying conditions. Airline announced they would reschedule flights and waive a fee. I am going to see how it pans out this week - if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t leaving soon, I would wait a few more days. Supposedly millions of kits will be available tomorrow and things may change drastically.  Personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the one to introduce the virus to my relatives.'
b'i think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign to stay home, especially if the airline offered a refund. i am in the same position. i had a trip scheduled to visit my dad in arizona (56) and i\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of cancelling too.'
b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s a good cancellation deal I\xe2\x80\x99d do it. And is also make sure your dad has a good supply of stuff and home and doing social distancing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be fine but the risk of carrying it to your dad is the scary part, so make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s ok the best you can from afar.'
b'I live in Ohio (where no one has been diagnosed yet - what a joke how would that be possible ?) and I swear no one cares.  The main response is that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d and I think to myself : I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this virus is not related to the flu virus? Anyways.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to talk to a few members of the family - 70+ year old conservatives - and I thought maybe I was getting through.  Not even being alarmist but just saying hey- maybe not the greatest time to go Walmart twice a week and maybe even rethink church or just don\xe2\x80\x99t shake hands.  One of them told me\nThe other day that they saw \xe2\x80\x9cPence on tv and he said it\xe2\x80\x99s the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d so it was the end of the conversation.  Yesterday they went to Walmart Sunday afternoon totally packed with people - saw a teenager with red face walking around wrapped in a hospital blanket - and told me that *I* would have been so scared.  Ok well at least I tried'
b'If you live in Wuhan/China, yes. Otherwise...probably going to get worse before it gets better.'
b'\nI am glad you asked.\nHere a video .\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg'
b"They dont ban accounts who say it's a hoax or just a flu. Fuck twitter"
b"Because you're spreading misinformation."
b"I think it's unlikely all of those countries will allow entry by April. Or that if they do you still want to go. Sorry, it sounds like a fun trip."
b'Not at all.'
b'Not irrational at all.'
b"No; it makes sense to at least weigh your options and assess the situation.\n\nStuff to consider in your decision include how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b"France is having it real bad right now, and aren't showing any signs of extreme clamping down on the problem.. Not sure you wanna go ahead with the trip. Might be wise actually"
b"They're not getting hit particularly hard.  It's just that we can only compare them to China and South Korea, two countries which used strict, widespread quarantines to slow the spread of the disease.  Italy is now trying (unsuccessfully) to quarantine an affected region; quarantines are not going to work in Iran.\n\nAs the virus spreads, most countries will look more like Italy and Iran than China."
b"They didn't manage to contain early cases as well, so they're several weeks ahead of other countries in virus progression."
b"I assume it's due to their close knit culture.  In Italy it is common to greet one another with a hug and/or light kiss on the cheek.  In Iran their religious culture revolves around praying with one another in close contact, ie mosques."
b"We're not sure; we think somewhere between hours and a few days. Worst-case guesstimate is 9 days, based on behavior of other coronaviruses.\n\nIt could, if an infected person coughed or sneezed on the sweater, and then an uninfected person touched that surface & later touched their eyes/nose/mouth without washing their hands in between."
b"No published research on this yet. \nbut this virus' cousin,  Sars and Mers, depends on different temperature and what object it is, the virus can stay alive on objects  from hours  to days. \nhowever sweater is kind of safe object.  Because there often are static electricity on sweater.  if the amount of virus is not large.  the virus simply just can't escape from your sweater. \nThis is also the theory how face mask can prevent your from virus.  There design to be static electricity on the face mask."
b"There's only a ~10% household transmission rate, so I wouldn't take it as a given, no. Definitely still worth doing what you can to prevent it, even if that's just regular hand washing & covering your mouth & nose with a tissue or elbow when you cough or sneeze.\n\nThat being said, if one of you get it, ideally both of you should self-isolate and stay home."
b"No.  According to China's research,  the total chance to infect a family member who live together is only 15%. \nthat means you still can make some move to avoid that situation. \nOpen windows,  don't sleep and eat together keep distance\xef\xbc\x8c constanly wearing mask for 24 hours\xef\xbc\x8cI think you already know these. \nWhat a I want to addtional remark is the BATHROOM.  quite a number of the patients,  their shit and urine contains huge number of virus, even more than in the mouth.  flash the toilet will splash the virus all over your bathroom. So in a very bad case that situation really happens,  do lot disinfect work in your bathroom."
b'Should probably vote for Bernie Sanders'
b"Most people won't even have to go to the doctor for it, it would only be problematic if you were one of the unlucky ones that had to be hospitalized.  Minimize close contact with other people and practice good hygiene and you should be ok."
b'Occasionally it gets a hug of death when someone features it on a major TV show like BBC or CNN'
b"Gloves don't really do much that hand washing doesn't also do, tbh. Like, if you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your face, it doesn't matter if it's with your bare hand or wearing a glove; you've still cross-contaminated.\n\nYou could use disposable gloves and swap out periodically, I guess, but again, you still need to make the effort to not touch your face.\n\nDefinitely wash your hands before you eat, after using the bathroom, and when you leave work/get home from being out and about, though!"
b"Incubation time is believed to be roughly two weeks, so a month between leaving the cruise and visiting y'all would be plenty of time for her to develop symptoms if she got infected (and if she wasn't asymptomatic, which we think might be a thing). May or may not be enough time to get over it before visiting y'all, though; depends when exactly she gets it and the severity."
b"Your mom is selfish and I'd refuse to allow her in my home as a lesson for that alone."
b'[This?](https://infection2020.com/)'
b"It's not guaranteed that mutations will make the virus stronger. I've actually read that mutations will tend towards decreasing death rate so to as ensure maximum transmission. We also don't yet understand the full long term ramifications of getting this virus. It would be silly to attempt to get it on purpose and may end up being something you regret doing."
b"I'd really ask an actual doctor about that before you even consider it, and... it just really feels like a bad idea to get infected intentionally."
b'It is mostly older folks & folks with underlying conditions, especially ones that impact their lungs, heart, or immune system.'
b"Poll numbers... stock market thats all he cares about... he'll lie and blame others regardless of the outcome."
b'$$$'
b'He\'s always been fascinated by numbers, ratings, and statistics. He thinks the higher the number of infected the worse he looks. He forgets that these "numbers" are actual people who are suffering and dying.'
b'China has been testing one million per week for several weeks, so no need to count.\n\nS.Korea has been doing a great job, by testing more than 20 thousands cases by far.\n\naround 1000 cases tested in USA and less than 2000 in Japan'
b'the only compilation list I have seen is from March 2: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/\n\nhopefully that will get updated soon, and it is far from a complete list but it at least gives you an idea. \n\nsome of those numbers come from government updates that are sent out as notices, instead of updating a central page, so they can be quite tedious to find. \n\nthe UK numbers are easy to find because they publish them on a gov site: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\n\ncanada posts the numbers in three different places, they all need to be added up:\n2008 + 553 + 2178 = 4,739 people tested, as of March 6\n\nsources:\nBC- http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus\n\nontario - https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus\n\nrest of canada - https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html'
b"If you're recently diagnosed and on Plaquenil, then it would be best to call your rheumatologist's office and communicate your concerns. Things like your ANA and C-reactive protein levels are easily available to them and they can advise you better than anyone on the internet. Lupus is what happens when your immune system goes haywire and starts attacking your own tissues, the medications are given in an effort to get the inflammatory process under control. Sometimes you have to experiment with different meds to get the right response; this is why the ANA and CRP are so important to monitor, that's how the rheumatologist knows if they're getting it close to right.\n\nDon't just stop your meds without talking with the rheumatologist office. They might actually advise you that it is appropriate to suspend taking them at times when you have an active infection. A phone call to the provider who knows your case is free, and doesn't have negative consequences for you.\n\nGood luck with all of this, it's been 4 years on Cellcept for me."
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Lupus but someone in my family has another autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis) and her doctor told her that she\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to require medical attention should she contract the virus, because of the biologicals she is on. Maybe best to ask your doctor if you can.'
b'Statistically not possible.  The Coronavirus had certain fatality rate for each age group. For President at age 74, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 8%(70-79yrs)\nFor VP it\xe2\x80\x99s 3.6% (60-69yrs) \nPlus all the heavyweight politicians had access to top medical facilities with highest priority, Even if they are infected, chance any of them dying is very slim. (Less than 1%, just like a flu)'
b"There is a chain of succession that goes to, like, fifty people. It won't come to that. Even if you're old, the odds of dying are still quite low. This isn't ebola."
b"If you've been exposed it's two weeks to make sure you don't have it. Working from home if you're able is indefinitely. If summer heat kills this thing it'd end then."
b"Ideally, you work from home as long as you're able, until the outbreak in your area has ended. But especially if you think you've been exposed, you want to stay home two weeks, and if you get *sick*, you want to stay home until you're better and then a bit longer to make sure you don't get worse again."
b'Its up to 2 weeks. You could show symptoms even quicker but 2 weeks is a good quarantine if exposed to find out if itll show.'
b'Bad virus'
b'It may also be that more news and articles are being posted online and in the sub related to the US, because there\xe2\x80\x99s the number of cases and widespread concern are both growing there.'
b'Use RES and setup a filter for the Flair USA and exclude it. That way the sub becomes much more usable again.\n\np.s. this is a credit to the Mods for flairs!'
b'There are many smaller subs for specific areas try searching your country + coronavirus.'
b"Corona tends to be mainly fever and a dry cough while the flu tends to also have sore throat and runny nose, but you can't distinguish by the symptoms alone."
b'By testing. Impossible otherwise.'
b"I don't think so.  The n95 mask uses electrostatic filters to prevent dirt. The medical device developer in the news reported that using heat, water or alcohol would damage the filter. I've never heard of an ozone generator, but water and heat measures are 100% damaging the filter, and most temporary measures are not good.\n\nkor news: [http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call\\_from=naver\\_news](http://www.korea.kr/news/reporterView.do?newsId=148869998&call_from=naver_news)"

b"''phase out just like that?''\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not phasing out, they simply took extreme measures that led to the decrease and some degree of containment."
b"Giving specific medical advice is frowned upon.\n\n\nWithout a test there's really no way to know if you have the nCoV, or one of the many other communicatable viruses, infections common in the world. All you can really do is treat your symptoms, limit your exposure to others like you should for any illness, get rest, maintain fluids and dietary intake. \n\n\nFor the vast overwhelming majority of cases it is mild to moderate symptoms that mirror the flu. I have a personal belief that mental health plays a big part of recovery, if you're worried and anxious you impact your body's ability to fight. \n\n\nIf you're worried keep a diary of your symptoms and any vitals you can monitor."
b'There are reported cases or a risk of community spread of COVID-19 in Antarctica.\n\nIf you travel to Antarctica:\n\nAvoid contact with sick people\nClean your hands often by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%\xe2\x80\x9395% alcohol\nPay attention to your health for 14 days after returning to the US. Stay home and seek medical advice if you get sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing\nAvoid travelling if you are sick\nVisit CDCs webpage for additional information about COVID-19.'
b'Extremely rarely.  Its hard to track exact numbers since its tough to 100% attribute a death to flu, so CDC mostly track pneumonia deaths and deaths that the doctor actually says was flu caused.  So most numbers you see are estimates.  But its around .1% or less for that age group.  Often these people have some sort of underlying undiagnosed issue which made them more susceptible, but you also just get an unlucky person sometimes.  Here are the numbers from 2018-2019.  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html'
b'My sister\xe2\x80\x99s friend passed away a few months ago and she was only 24. No health issues. Unfortunately it happens and doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.'
b"It's really your decision whether or not to go; we can't make that call for you. But stuff to consider in that decision are how important the trip is to you, whether you're able to get much/any money/credit back if you cancel, whether you have any risk factors for this disease (like being over the age of 60 or so, or having heart disease/high blood pressure/lung issues/compromised immune system), whether others in your life have risk factors, and what the situation is where you're going."
b'You are not overreacting. \nWait till Thursday check the numbers in Spain and the neighbours and decide.'
b'Sad news is fatality in college students are very low. (Which means most of them don\xe2\x80\x99t care) \nBut they do spread out the virus to all parts of states,  their parents should be worried.'
b"Not an expert but here what me and my husband have been doing. Wash hands asap, don't touch anything, dry hands off with paper towel or put towel in laundry right away. Disinfect the knobs with Lysol wipe."
b'He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in the first place.\n\nBut if he do come into your house,  you two are basically bonded together if your two don\xe2\x80\x99t wear masks in house.'
b'I told my parents so they won\xe2\x80\x99t freak out on Coronavirus.  \nBut honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.   \nThe SARS (which is another Coronavirus) disappeared in Late May 2003.  So there are some chances, but nobody knows for sure.'
b"What's true is: nobody knows. People who say this are speculating. This disease is more infectious than the flu and it is currently spreading in southern hemisphere countries that are actively in summer. A more likely speculation is that spread may slow in the summer due to a number of factors (kids out of school, more vitamin d in people's systems, warmer temps mean it lives shorter periods on surfaces), but it will still spread."
b'If it was so why are we seeing spread into the warmer tropical climates. Singapore is aggressively managing but still reporting cases and has temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius everyday.'
b'Many viruses "tend" to prefer cooler temps and may not last as long on surfaces in warmer weather.  This is true of the flu and why you see it drop off in warmer temps.  I suspect no one can give a correct answer for whether this strain will be the same way as it is present in warmer countries right now.  Also, in the summer people are outside more, school is out, there tends to be less transmission.  I suspect we will see a lull over the Summer (in the northern hemisphere) with maybe even a return of it in the Fall.'
b'The majority of recovery come from China, they had the virus under control.  With less than 100 cases per day and decreasing.\n\nBut in other parts of world,  the cases doubles every two or three days.'
b"> She said that people in the UK don't take the virus seriously\n\nOur problems here are similar to issues across, I imagine, a lot of the Western world. In that we *don't* experience existential challenges or threat regularly, if at all, and so are less inclined to recognise the severity of a situation or threat until it becomes very apparent it is real. Also the experience and outlook of a Londoner, a very young reasonably healthy and affluent City, will be different our towns. I think a lot of people are happier to risk it than sit indoors. \n\n> She also wrote that whoever wear a mask on the subway will be considered as people who are having the virus\n\nAlso sadly think this will likely be because the woman is Asian and either consciously or subconsciously people, in a confined setting, will act differently around her - naturally this is racist. \n\n\nWith regards to testing, the UK Govts advice or treatment approach doesn't change, irrespective of whether you are tested or not, positive or not. Stay at home, self-isolate - the UK government have introduced laws to make it easier to obtain statutory sick pay and employers here are seemingly very comfortable with you working from home or being sick. There's very little the NHS can do for someone with a mild fever and so if you claim to have more severe symptoms they will act more assertively. In the context of limited capacity to carry out tests, this is the right thing to do."
b"I'm from the UK, and it all sounds roughly correct.\n\nYour post makes it sounds like you think the above is a problem.\n\nThe UK (Government & Public) **are** taking it seriously, we just aren't succumbing to hysteria and panic.\n\nIf/when we get to the point where there are tens of thousands of infected, I imagine attitudes will change and people will be more aggressive in distancing/isolating. Until then, we'll keep washing our hands, avoiding touching our faces, and self-isolating if we display symptoms, as advised by the NHS and other experts."
b'Chances are she just has cold/flu.  That is extremely more likely, but there is always a chance she has covid-19.  She should call her doctor and get a recommendation.  That is what the CDC is telling people to do who think they are sick.'
b'Why bother getting tested?  If you (and they) are worried, just take the same precautions as if they have it.   Treat symptoms and self-quarantine.'
b"Same thing in the UK with me. Called 111 and they said it was just a cough. Four days later I call again and they say it's a chest infection \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 hopefully it doesn't progress"
b"Sorry not helpful but I saw a video on Youtube of a man in China volunteering to feed pets in people's homes. They were abandoned due to Wuhan being quarantined so owners outside the city can't return. The video description estimates 30,000 pets abandoned in the city."
b'Sure they are. The government of Iran never tells the true numbers.'
b'Seattle is a prime spot for Cruise Ships. That could have something to do with it.'
b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter. If it had hit a daycare facility or elementary school, there would be no deaths at all. But there probably would have been faster community spread, from those kids to their parents and then beyond.\n\nSource: Am a parent. Have had many cold and flu bugs brought home by our kids over the years.'
b"Not enough info.  If she's going to be in a large group, where in Seattle, etc."
b'Hi! I live in Seattle.\n\nThe likelihood of your mom contracting the virus and passing it on to you and the kids is small, but definitely not zero.  She will probably be fine if she observes the commonly-suggested hygiene practices, e.g., thorough and often hand-washing, covering coughs, keeping a 6-foot distance between herself and others as much as possible, etc.\n\nIs her trip to Seattle absolutely necessary?  Is the small chance of contracting Covid-19 worth it?\n\nHonestly, if she were my mom and the "one day trip" was recreational, I\'d urge her not to go.  Or at least postpone it for a few months.'
b'Seattle is essentially shut down right now. There is talk of bringing in the military. Your mom should not go.'
b'Toucht anything contaminated without washing your hands correctly, or getting closer than 2 meters to an infected person can result in contagion. If you are in an active circulating virus region.'
b"If you keep your distance from other people and don't touch things, it's perfectly fine to go out for a walk."
b"I'm sorry, but asthmatic and diabetic would be two risk factors on the list, I'd push back if I were you. You are younger which is good, but this is a respiratory disease."
b"Until we know how much disruption this causes, it's impossible to say what the country is going to look like 8 months from now."
b"I don't think that's a significant concern with respiratory infections, though I'm not an expert."
b'Probably not; runny nose and sneezing are not symptoms, and coughing is.'
b'1 week of incubation, + about 1-2 weeks of symptoms... Then you recover, if your body can do so. If not, you end up in intensive care.'
b"That's not the problem as far as testing goes. Plenty of people want to be tested, but the tests the CDC produced were fucked up and now they don't have enough functional tests to test everybody who wants one. Even the hospitals who have suspected cases cannot get those patients tested. \n\nThe problem in the US is a lack of test availability. Whether this is due to incompetence or politics is an ongoing debate."
b'I live in Ohio (where no one has been diagnosed yet - what a joke how would that be possible ?) and I swear no one cares.  The main response is that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust the normal flu\xe2\x80\x9d and I think to myself : I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this virus is not related to the flu virus? Anyways.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the link unfortunately, but I did read somewhere that most of their cases were under 40 years of age. If I come across that article again, I will post it here.'
b'Coronavirus still hasn\'t beaten "Talking about fantasy football", but is well ahead of "Complaining about the last season of Game of Thrones."'
b"I understand how much the government can enforce some of these things differ by countries, but I think the general population's tendency to stay home and not interact with each other will be similar all around the world. It's really sad if you think about it."
b'Considering how seriously the Koreans have been taking this, it might not be a month for many of us.'
b"I've spent enough time in the US to know how much things differ between Korea and the States. I feel like it's going to be so much tougher for you to deal with this :("
b"The surgical masks won't help at all with protecting you from becoming infected from airborne viruses. It doesn't adequately filter the air you breathe.\n\nThey can help you not infect yourself by preventing you from touching your face and they can reduce the rate at which you infecting others (after you're infected).\n\nThey do very very little to actually help as a preventative measure over all.\n\nThe full-cover air filtering ones might help depending on their grade."
b"> Man, makes me realize even moreso how out of their league our current govt (US) is at handling this situation.\n\nYes, completely, utterly.  But it's not just fucknut trump and his team of lackeys.  Many states and local governments are fucking things up. Why hasn't the boston marathon been cancelled? Why hasn't the st patricks day parades in boston, Chicago, and ny been cancelled?"
b">  is more concerned about controlling the information and making everything seem like it's fine instead of trying to protect\n\n... which is, 1:1, how China handled it."
b'Authoritarianism governments are all about controlling information. In a democracy that information is used to control the opinions of the constituents. This is to ensure the maintenance of power over time.'
b'Because Republicans are pieces of shit bro where you been'
b"Absolutley, same in Australia. We will reach much higher numbers, I hate to think what it's going to be like in 3 months time."
b"I'd second that regarding the UK. We're going to have major problems. And when increasingly draconian measures come into play the 'I know my rights' brigade will play merry hell.  \n\nThe Cheltenham festival is being held this week. 250,000 people from the global racing world all descending on Gloucestershire and Cheltenham. It's unfathomable how this is being allowed to go ahead...."
b'My guess is that most of the cult members are done being tested, so that probably brought the number of new cases down.'
b"I tried to mentions the little things and small inconveniences that you might encounter that you probably would not expect. I'll try and add more as I think of them."
b"In fairness to SNL - it's a sketch show meant to provide stupid humor to make you laugh.\n\nThere are news outlets that haven't put out anything better than SNL has on this, and their claim to fame isn't 'D\\*ck in a Box'."
b"They won't be laughing 6-8 weeks from now..."
b"Yeah, I saw the episode and really didn't get the impression at all that they were making fun of preparations.  That Sands of Modesto sketch (which I think is the one in question) seemed to be set in a dystopian pandemic future and was just making fun of the absurdities of life then.  I guess some people don't get irony and satire and are just taking the content at face value."
b"I agree firmer approach would've been possible, but compared to other countries, I am happy with how Pres. Moon and the goverment as a whole has responded to the situation. Also, I feel the cult would've found a way to fuck things up no matter how firm our initial response was."
b"They obviously has worse infrastructure to deal with this stuff so I suspect it'll be devastating. At the same time, I don't think we'll be able to get any credible numbers and data about it so we'll never know for sure how bad it was :("
b"It depends on the country, but I live in one of the biggest cities in the world in Seoul and it's not THAT bad. You're taking a risk whenever you step out of the house but you can still buy food, goto reastaurants (if you want to), and do whatever if you want."
b'Thanks, I hope the fact that the US has much lower population density than Korea works to your benefit.'
b"AFAIK, it's a Christianity based church (cult) that thinks its leader Lee Man Hwee is a resurrection of Jesus Christ or something. They're infamous for trying to recruit people off the street with lies, secretively infiltrating other religions to poach out members, secretive about their membership, and most recently, members lying about their attendance in their crowded mass and jump starting Korea's outbreak. You can read more here.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shincheonji_Church_of_Jesus"
b"Yeah, I've got friends in Daegu who's in total lockdown mode. We're not at that level yet, but feels like it could escalate any day."
b"This isn't an abstract kind of recession, either.  You can see the root causes easily.\n\nA recession means a reduction in GDP.  GDP is a measure of how much business is occurring within a country.\n\nWhen people stay in the house and buy only essentials, less business occurs.  Period.  Done.  End of story.  \n\nAdjusting interest rates doesn't get at the root cause of this recession.\n\nNow, in a normal recession, different things are driving the reduction in business.  Take the commercial truck manufacturing business, for instance.  Those commercial trucks last a decade or so, and  they tend to be bought when business are growing, and replaced about ten years later (or at the end of the truck's planned service life, whatever it is).  This tends to make the demand for commercial trucks cyclical, which is rough on everyone. In this case, having lower than expected interest rates can cause a business to adjust it's scheduled fleet upgrade plans a bit, because a lower-than-usual interest rate can save them money and make them more profitable.\n\nThis is not a normal recession, though.  Interest rates have been kept abnormally low for the last few years, because the US federal reserve has faced political pressure to keep the party going.  So, they've used all of their arrows before the enemy showed up.  Plus, their usual tools aren't all that useful for addressing the root cause anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, our usual tools won't blunt the economic blow here.  But, in the USA, the land of no social-safety-net, the economy *is* linked to our individual/family survival. so we have to talk about it in conjunction with the human toll, because they are one and the same for us."
b'Same me last week.'
b"I have both re-read The Stand and re-watched Contagion in the past day or so (well, I've been reading The Stand for a few weeks now...it's a long ass book...almost to the end). \n\nI loved to self-trigger myself."
b"Me too! It's oddly therapeutic.  Watching this excellent movie takes all the shapeless anxiety buzzing around in my head and gives it a narrative structure and somewhere to land.  I feel better after I watched it last night."
b"I 100% agree with you! \n\n\nThis is me in everyday life tbh. I'm completely no stress when it comes to everything (on a side note, I don't even have an interest in learning anything about history, as it's already happened & I can't do anything about it \xf0\x9f\x98\x82)\n\n\nMy SO is pretty worried at the potential of this virus so I'm 100% on board with taking precautions - we're washing our hands more regularly (although we're pretty hygeic like that anyway), we're taking steps to avoid large groups where possible, we're using disinfectant sprays more often & we have equipped our kids with their own hand sanitizer & info on not sharing school supplies, not touching their faces, etc.\n\n\nI am not worried personally, if it comes we'll deal with it - but I'd never judge someone whose worried or play this thing down."
b'I think they did (in an esoteric sense). The risk to individual Americans may be low, but the systemic risk is high. The stock market is focused on systemic risks, not individual risks. This is precisely why politic talk to "soothe" the masses has done nothing to curb the market free fall. The system has every reason to panic even if individuals don\'t.'
b'Actually the market likely did. The market is concerned due to a whole host of factors. Supply chain issues, economic effects of people social distancing, cancellations of events, major economic hits to travel industry etc.'
b"Government is actually doing what they can. Mistakes were made in past years, but there's no time for complaining."
b"like they do delivery and pickup, but don't know which for about 14 days."
b'Thanks, that was what I was thinking. A friend suggested it might be a scam which had my head spinning in another direction.\n\nI will wait to hear from the travel agent.  We have flown to Ireland via LAX before so not a huge deal, although visas would need to be obtained.  \n\nWe are leaning towards cancellation at this stage. We dont particularly want to get trapped in Europe, and really dont want to expose our loved ones (specifically my elderly MIL) to anything we collect on the way.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s really crazy right?? I went to a follow up doctor appointment today and the doctor shook my hand. WTF.'
b'Hamsters can be used as toilet paper, then washed and used again.'
b'I think its a German phrase for when people go and "panic shop" like a hamster filling its check pouches with seeds'
b'In german we say "Hamsterk\xc3\xa4ufe" which basically means, that people empty out supermarkets and stock up an unnecessary amount of food at home.'
b"I think it's the same as stockpiling."
b'Toilet paper is sold out everywhere for example'
b'This. 70% ethanol is best. 100% drys out too quickly'
b'FWIW China has not reported any deaths under the age of 10, nor has the rest of the world.'
b'I wanted to say something along those lines, but I know my wife would chew me out for it.\n\nIt was so incredibly surreal.'
b'Has the UK tested previous flu tests against covid-19?\n\nFinland did that, and I just wonder if any other country has done so.'
b"Thank you. I don't know where you are, but I hope the whole world gets to be rid of this virus soon."
b'I certainly agree it would be difficult to implement.   But on 9/11, they managed to ground 4,000 aircraft in a matter of hours on a split-second decision.  That seemed like it would have been nearly impossible to implement, but they made it happen.'
b'Hooray for fucking capitalism!'

b"*waves in African\n\nSouth Africa has 4 cases so far, all coming from Italy, but there a report this morning of a suspected case where the person never left SA so we'll see"
b'No panic, just very concerned. Given the recent news, not reporting numbers would seen like a perfect action to take to stop people from reacting. \n\nThere a lot of politicians and others with vested interest to keep constituents in the dark for as long as possible. People worried about poll numbers and the economy first, and human lives second are in charge in a lot of places right now.'
b'I believe they are including state reports, actually, but they only update at noon on weekdays, so their count lags behind.'
b'Surely the risk alone should be enough. Hopefully they make the smart decision'
b"Yeah airlines don't offer refunds unless the situation is dire. I'd take the refund"
b'You hit it right on the head with not wanting to be the one to introduce the virus to anyone; relatives, especially. I rarely follow the news and this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on Reddit in months so I had no idea this was becoming an epidemic. I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be keeping up with this subreddit now. Thanks for the response!'
b'I just checked out that useful interactive map someone made and posted to this subreddit. Turns out there\xe2\x80\x99s a confirmed case in Manatee Cty. where my dad lives. No doubt about it \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the refund and begging him to stay indoors.'
b'Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly worried about being a carrier and possibly infecting my dad and other people. Just can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure when a case will show up by chance in my airport. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the cancellation.'
b'I agree, I think the US in particular is in for a rough ride. But if Wuhan is already coming good, that\'s gotta be a good sign right? There\'s been a few deaths, and I know this might come off as heartless, but nowhere near the apocalyptic scenario I\'ve been coming to expect. Or did China just nip it early and the rest of the world is in a "calm before the storm" phase?'
b'Perfect! Thank you!'
b'Okay thanks for the info.'
b'34 days after returning form the cruise is more than enough to cover incubation time for the virus, your response would be irrational.'
b'Do you have a source on that?  I have never seen any breakdown of hospitalization rate by age.'
b'The UK has tested 23,513 people.'
b'do you have a source for china testing 1m/week? (not questioning, im just interested)'
b'very bad, but atleast i\xe2\x80\x99m back in standard time so i\xe2\x80\x99m happy'
b"Just like I had said in my comment above, if you are worried, just treat it as if you were infected.   Self-quarantine.   Treat the symptoms.  There is no cure.   If you are relatively healthy, you'll get over it like any other case of the flu."
b"Yea :( - I'm only 42 so hopefully I'll survive if it finds me.  And hopefully the virus itself doesn't do more damage than what is known so far (or potential for relapse/chronic issues).  \n\nI really appreciate what you wrote.  I read it aloud to my wife who thinks I'm being overly panicked about this (as many Americans do about other Americans who are paying attention).   \n\nStay well!"
b"Sure, but with this virus there is evidence that you are contagious before showing symptoms. \n\nSo better to assume you are infected and act accordingly if it's reasonable.\n\nThat might mean having a mask handy but not wearing it all the time; but if you already have a supply of masks there would be little reason not to wear one."
b"There's also a case to be made that surgical masks will help you from getting milder illnesses which would weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to contracting more serious illnesses."
b'Except they actually did things while making out everything is fine.   It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d while testing millions of people, shutting down cities etc and another thing to say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is fine\xe2\x80\x9d and force everyone to _act_ like everything is fine.    It\xe2\x80\x99s like the crew on the titanic refusing to lower lifeboats and telling everyone to go back to bed.'
b'Also in Australia they tell us no need for everyone to wear a mask.'
b"You'd have to be fucking mental to attend anything right now. If the govt. et al won't shut things down we need to just opt-out ourselves asap."
b"There's 317,000 church members and they're testing 10,000 people per day over there.  You might be right about that.  In which case, the drop in new cases wouldn't necessarily be reflective of the virus situation in the country at large."
b'I saw that and really appreciated it. We keep seeing official guidelines and general recommendations, but I suspect living in an area with an ongoing quarantine effort or just more social distancing affects so many little parts of everyday life.\n\nThere are so many parts of society, jobs, and routine activities that this will likely be disrupted for some time.\n\nIt must feel surreal, and maybe only more so as you get used to it.'
b'Thanks for this aspect, and everything else you\xe2\x80\x99re doing for us all. \n\nBecause of the little details I\xe2\x80\x99m now wondering what preparations I might do. Like resupplying kids craft supplies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to; and other preparations that I take so that we survive school  holidays. (New card games and board games; sports equipment; frozen meals for me coz I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted having a kid here 24hr a day;  etc.)\n\nI only just survived the Christmas holidays - I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to be unexpectedly struck down by school closures!'
b'[deleted]'
b'In case others are wondering how something like contact details are "mixed up".  It actually happens to me all the time.\n\nI travel frequently for work, as per company policy I have to book through our corporate travel agents, and they only accept company email addresses.  I\'m a member of a couple of Frequent Flyer programs. To take advantage of the mileage accruals, I ask the travel agency to indicate my frequent flyer number.  When they do that, the travel booking appears in my personal airline login.  Once the link is made, the airlines will notify me (via my personal email address and registered phone number) directly of any changes, seat selections, meal choices, and early check-in communications.  In fact I get more comms from airlines about my upcoming travel than I do from the travel agents.'
b'Seems better than the three seashell method.'
b"Haha, gotcha. In the US a hamster is a small rodent, and I thought Germans were 'stocking up' on rodents at the supermarket for some reason."
b"the reason 70% is used more widely than 100% is that water content helps penetrate cell membranes and walls. There is no need to use 100% ethanol, it's not more effective than 70%. \n\nsource: years of research"
b'I mean, that was a specific, already highly-regulated industry, not literally everyone & everything. Not a great comparison.'
b'The worst -ism'
b'First of all: will there be flights to get there?\n\nSecondly: will there be enough officials and volunteers?\n\nThird: will people not from Japan want to take the risk to travel there and maybe get stuck in quarantine.'
b'Good choice! I wish you and your family well.'
b'China had an extremely aggressive response, which most of the rest of the world will not be able/willing to match.'
b"The problem is China can completely control their citizens so even though the botched the beginning they could stop everything in key places. Western governments won't have it so easy"
b'Yes, https://www.biocentury.com/article/304545/who-china-makes-and-deploys-1-6-million-covid-19-tests-week-the-u-s-is-just-starting-to-ramp-up-capacity\n\nactually WHO said China now test up to 1.6 million cases per week, more than I mentioned above.\n\nActually, if you are from Japan, Korea, Iran, Italy, you will be tested upon arrival airports in some cities in China for free, and receive the results no later than two days, since you are not suspect case, and if you have fever, your result will be returned within hours'
b'It was light out till 6:30 today! So happy to see that. I hope this is the last time we have to change our clocks in BC.'
b"The difficulty with that is most people can't afford to not work for 2 weeks and unless it's recommended by a medical professional that you self quarantine it'll be difficult to get sick pay."
b'I imagine the main concern for you guys is people without health insurance will not want to present themselves for treatment for fear of ridiculous costs. Prob the only 1st world country where people have to prioritse money over health. Hopefully your govt provides funding in some way.'
b"It's more than just us surviving though, the big concern is if we catch it then pass it onto other people who have much worse chances of survival."
b"To be fair, they are correct. Most people have no idea how to properly use masks, to the degree where random Europeans or Americans suddenly deciding to use masks will probably **increase** their odds of getting infected. There's a lot of issues regarding to how to equip/unequip masks (i.e. you have a high chance of infecting yourself if you touch the front parts of a long-worn mask), the fact that most masks aren't meant to be used more than a few hours, and will end up accumulating bacteria / infectious particles when used for days, etc etc etc.\n\nConversely, the people who should be using masks are those already infected, because here the primary purpose is to reduce the amount of infectious droplets leaving their mouse/nose. (Technically, they could even wear the same mask for multiple days, because anything they use and wear will be contaminated anyways...)\n\nSo, if the government flat-out issues statements of 'don't rush and buy all the masks and start spamming their use', that's actually legitimate (if not very explanatory) advice."
b"Not saying you're wrong, but as of right now those issues are all out of my control. I hope the amazing people trying hard to come up with the cure/vaccine succeed sooner than later, and everyone around me takes basic precautions like washing hands and wearing masks. But for me and my family, we're just trying to survive this mess without contacting the virus and not go out of our mind from not being able to live like we used to."
b'Lol calm down dude. Korea is handling this exceptionally well, their rate of new cases is actually declining. The same can be said of China, which is starting to re-open schools. Source: https://twitter.com/business/status/1236877340615081984'
b'Be well John Spartan.'
b'a Hamster is the small rodent in german as well. Hamesterk\xc3\xa4ufe means, that people a stocking up like a hamster, because hamster store their food in their cheeks'
b'that would be amazing'
b'Yeah, but as you stated, the main benefit of wearing a mask is that people that are infected spread fewer infectious germs. So it makes absolutely sense for everyone to wear one (assuming enough are available), since nobody knows if they are infected and might be spreading corona'
b"Very cute expression. I love it.\n\nAlso very relieved to hear Germans don't eat hamsters. :)"

b"As bad as the Chinese govie messed up at least they are making an effort to help. They would be within the right to say fuck you pay us. So I am in no way a Chinese govie cheerleader but if you don't give props where props(carrot) are due then the stick you get later has no real meaning.\n\nWe should be encouraging China by not always looking down our noses and treating the people with respect. I was deeply saddened to hear Asian Americans (I assume from all countries as my fellow American is on average pretty racist/ ignorant apparently) that they were buying guns for protection from other Americans due to Covid-19 attacks.(I didn't hear of any attacks but the one guy that got beat up) \n\nNot trying to veer into politics so forgive me if I crossed that line but we need to be encouraging of all countries to be honest about their responses to this so that we can learn. The good the bad and the ugly. 1918 SF had a lot of things we can draw from but it was a different world then and almost impossible to think of all the ways those differences affect(effect?) Current global economy, goods transfer both physical and digital(since wfh is being ramped up) even education and resource allocation. Hell even the population density/locations have changed in big ways in some cases. Say Detroit vs Seattle (assuming that back in the day Seattle was not quite so packed I'm only mid 30's so I don't really remember very far). This data matters and yeah we got shit data to start but if I remember correctly the Chinese people are very proud and it shows in the govie. Japan is much the same. Here in America we are shocked at Japanese officials apologizing for late trains..Money is a big motivator but it's not the only one so let's capitalize on the opportunity to improve the world for everyone. \n\nNo I don't expect China to stop the awful stuff but how much can we really bad mouth them with the shit American govie does to not only our own but others.....our track record isn't clear and I think we should clean our own house while we are busy pointing fingers elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear this isn't a demo vs repub thing or a pro/anti (fill-in the blank president) this is learning to look past country flaws and see humans as humans and not enemies."

b"You misunderstand the word globalization. They don't mean people thinking we are all the same inhabitants of spaceship earth, they mean using sweatshops to produce stuff for cheap and shipping it to rich countries for profit.\n\nIf supply lines cannot be trusted there will be more interest in reshoring."
b'If anything I gained more respect about how the Chinese handled the corona crisis in the last few weeks. Compared to how the west is handling the situation, they are an example.\n\nEdit: please stop spamming my mailbox with insults and threats (wtf?). I never said I respect their regime as a whole, I meant to say we can learn a thing or two about their drastic quarantining measures and to actually acknowledge this threat as one instead of being complacent like most western countries at this moment.'
b'This is why I dont like that countries are blocking the exports of masks'
b"Chinese people still need visas to travel and vice versa. Unless 'ending globalization' means shutting down your borders, nothing is changing. Especially since all the cheap tech everyone likes cant be made in any of our countries, lest the prices go up by 100% at least."
b'Nope this will have the opposite effect, it will give extremist leaders and excuse to be more secure about borders'
b'I think people think this will end globalism not globalization'
b'Diverting resources or doctors globally to the worse hit areas would be nice to see. Airline and hotel industry is worried about the impact this is having on them but damn they could be used to help move resources around to contain it or limit how much of a strain this is having on hospitals'

b'Reminds me of [this sort story](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/27uj8j/oc_when_i_think_about_the_humans_i_dont_think_of/)'
b'I would not be surprised if we start seeing Chinese health personell shipped to affected countries within a couple of weeks. They have the knowledge, and noone else has capacity to spare workforce. During the peak of the outbreak 40,000 health workers in China got shipped to Wubei, a province with a population of \\~60 million, Italy has a population of \\~60 million, and they will summon 40,000 health workers from... where? Other parts of Europe may be in the same situation as them very soon.'
b"We  don't have enough trained medic in intensive care even for the 1st world countries."
b"Aren't the Swiss just Mountain Germans?"
b'Germany passed an export stop for masks and desinfectants  iirc'
b'What is coincidental is the same thing happened in China one month before too, the city Dali withheld an order meant for another county Chengdu and in turn gave them away to local government officials and real estate companies. Watching the same story happen twice in different places is nothing but a reminder of we human beings are the same regardless of culture and race.'
b'> heartwarming\n\nnah that\xe2\x80\x99s just the sepsis kicking in.'
b'Back in February when the outbreak was only severe in China, Japan donated  thousands of masks to China in boxes that has traditional Chinese poetry on its labels. It \nwent viral on Chinese internet and many people were deeply moved by the simple gesture. Now they are doing the same thing when exporting mask to other countries.\n\nI hope this becomes a trend in the coming months when countries have to help each other fighting the virus. It\xe2\x80\x99s so adorable.'

b'..mind you that China is still in a trust battle with the EU in adopting their 5g tech which is widely known to be spyware.'

b'I dont think they actually fucked up that much with this Corona situation, yea they were slow at first and tried to hide shit, but when they understood what they were dealing with, the reaction was one of a kind and they went to incredibly extremes to contain it. They shutdown half the fucking country, tanked their economy, and still somehow are able to produce a gigantic amount of masks and tests to try an mitigate this the best they can.

b'Globalisation more or less means embracing global trade. Inevitably, companies will purchase labour as cheaply as they can get it and people will work for those companies if it provides a better life than they had before.'
b'You are absolutely correct but at the same time you completely miss the big picture. \n\n1. Poor people escape malnutrition and huger into  cities. They live in slums and scavenge landfills if nothing else.  China for example has almost eradicated hunger  but it still exists in some places in countryside. \n2. People in sweatshops are one step above people in absolute poverty in  countryside, streets and landfills.  \n3. Poor people in developed countries lose their jobs to people in developing countries. \n4. Net effect is better living standards overall even for the poor, but poor are always doomed to worse conditions in everywhere. \n\nGlobalization is net benefit for the humanity and it works trough magic of comparative advantage.  The adverse effects of globalization come from governments not reducing inequality within their countries or having global standards that mitigate  adverse effects.'
b"Ironically I think the end result of globalization, after it envelopes more and more facets of everyone's lives over time, is the eradication of sweat shops and realization of workers' rights for all. It's just a mud and blood entrenched trail to get there. It's inevitable."
b"I'd love to see how many Americans can afford $40 t-shirts produced in the USA. I'm also pretty sure most Americans *don't want* the jobs that have been sent to other countries. 14 hour shifts at insanely demanding and monotonous manufacturing jobs that pay peanuts? The only people that live here who want those jobs are immigrants that anti-globalists want to get rid of. Can you imagine how much all of this technology we're addicted to would cost at US wages?\n\nPoorer countries absolutely need better labor standards, and US companies that are outsourcing should be more picky with their suppliers and use leverage to ensure they don't end up with factories in their supply chain with suicide nets or textile plants that are on the verge of collapse. That said, we aren't getting away from globalism unless we resign ourselves to a much lower quality of life. 95% of Americans couldn't afford a smartphone if it was produced in the US."
b"This. I'm still cynical somewhat about the CCP but not every Chinese person tows the official line. Stuff like this serves a reminder that each chinese is a person before a communist, and that no matter what you think of a government, the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI think this is a beautiful act from a company and can further strengthen relations in the future once this is done by. How we treat our neighbours, especially when it's under control within our own borders, may play a big part in how people see us in the future"
b"Hey I'm good with the quarantine urgency, just not how they could have snipped this in the bud at the start but instead went and silenced people. Then again western is shaping up to not really do much better, just fail differently."
b'The whole reason we are in this mess is because Chinese government ignored the warnings of the doctors in wuhan who were warning them that it will be bad, for like two months... and not only ignoring them but not allowing them to speak to media etc. to say oh maybe you should wash your hands more and not go outside as much.'
b"Well both respect and shame them on how they've handled it. They did build hospitals and were effective. However they silenced it at the start, witch might have lead to a bigger problem than if they just admitted at the start"
b'Lol only on Reddit do I see constant boot licking for China... thinking...'

b"Makes sense if you think it's going to spread everywhere soon. Prevents other countries from buying up your stock and leaving your own country with less. Of course it has all sorts of secondary effects and it'll probably end up in some EU court in a few years after this all blows over."
b'Credit to the Japanese. It\'s one of the only things I find heart-warming about this terrible disaster. Someone needs to repost it to r/HumansBeingBros .\n\nNow, Chinese people followed this fashion and donated masks to other countries with quotes from their own classic literature. \n\nMy favorite ones are: to Daegu, Korea: "the roads cannot estrange people, there\'s no border between human beings", by Choe Chiwon, a Korean scholar who studied in China during the 9th century; to Iran: "The children of Adam are the members of each other, who are in their creation from the same essence. When day and age hurt one of these members, other members will be left (with) no serenity. If you are unsympathetic to the misery of others, it is not right that they should call you a human being", a famous quote from Saadi.'
b"I'm told that Chinese who live in Japan made this idea from the beginning. But I don't have strong resource to proof this point, just wanna say what you heard might not be the truth. Anyway, the result is people in Italy who need masks now have more supplies."
b'Can you elaborate on that, what did the japanese do?'

b'This is all true but you have to remember some people don\xe2\x80\x99t care if there is more suffering in China and would welcome it.'
b"You must have taken an economics course at some point or ran into some libertarian ideology and didn't look to closely. \n\nYou point to the positive and ignore the negative. You see people in poor countries get a little richer and ignore people in rich countries getting poorer. You believe in a linear direction for all countries; only ever better and richer. But that is not the world we live in. If things were getting better [deaths of despair](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html) would not be a thing. The formerly rich fall further down than the formerly poor rise up. This is a necessary fact, otherwise the job would not be outsourced in the first place.\n\nYou also put too much stock into the comparative advantage argument. This argument assumes that all competition is only between people and not between people and machines, it assumes that there are always needs to be fulfilled, and it assumes that people will always be able to make enough money to cover their basic needs allowing for, you know, survival. None of these assumptions hold in the real world.\n\nIn the real world a machine would compete with the human, the value of labor can drop below what the human needs for survival and another death of despair would happen. The machine will only get better over time."
b"You are more optimistic than me. So far what I see is the power of unions being undermined and a race to the bottom for work conditions. And I don't believe in the 'it needs to get worse before it gets better' mantra.\n\nLet's agree to disagree."
b'> , the people are innocent and react to this just like us. \n\nI can understand paying less attention to your government when your living situation as a citizen is improving so quickly that your income doubles every few years. While you still remember living in poverty when you where young. You just want them to keep doing what they are doing.\n\nThis certainly doesnt mean that the international community should let the Chinese Government get away with their crimes though.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s your excuse in the West to run around like headless rats?'
b'Exactly - had they been transparent about what was going on, and addressed doctors concerns instead of silencing and arresting them, maybe they wouldn\'t have needed such draconian measures afterward to try to combat the virus.\n\nWith total control of information going in or out, though, I would be very reluctant to "respect" anything they\'ve done there.  I don\'t think the US is making the right moves re: quarantine, but I don\'t think throwing anyone who so much as looks sick into the back of a white van to be "quarantined" against their will is any better.'
b"Isn't everyone who is not from Switzerland?"

b"The quote that went along with the donations from Japan to China was actually used more than a thousand years ago during Chinese Tang Dynasty when, for the sake of communicating the knowledge of Buddha, Japanese authority made and sent thousands of Buddha gowns to Chinese monks, and all the gowns were embroidered with kanji \xe5\xb1\xb1\xe5\xb7\x9d\xe5\xbc\x82\xe5\x9f\x9f \xe9\xa3\x8e\xe9\x9b\xa8\xe5\x90\x8c\xe5\xa4\xa9, which roughly means mountains and rivers on different lands, wind and rain under the same sky.

b"I made a similar comment a while ago about my Redmi Note 7 Pro and also got one or two people saying that I was an ad bot, it's really a bit silly as they are genuinely very good phones and most people seem to just not even consider them and are willing to pay twice the price for the same specs just because they are a chinese company and they associate chinese products with bad quality or something like that. You can basically get the specs of a \xc2\xa3500-\xc2\xa3600 phone (by one of the mainstream manufacturers) for something like \xc2\xa3200-\xc2\xa3300 with no real downsides. One of the things about them is that they all have very impressive cameras on them often similar to the expensive flagship phones.\n\nSome people complain that the phones all have built in ads and bloatware but I personally don't get any ads with the default Chinese MIUI firmware. Obviously English is a language option and after installing the Google apps it's basically just like any other normal phone."

b"The value of labor was always going to drop as soon as we got machines. Labor isn't as valuable an asset as it was 50 years ago, that's why it's easier to ship it off to third world countries where it is a bit more valued. That's why higher education and training is important, clinging to dying industries and denigrating globalization is meaningless."
b'My take: The end of "globalization" (as defined 3 comments above) will happen when automation takes over - when AI and machinery become more advanced and cost-efficient than a human laborer. \n\nBut it\'s gonna come with its own set of issues, looking at the Mouse Utopia experiment.'
b"I agree with you wholeheartedly.  This incentivizes poor conditions for workers.  You're going to let unions demand better conditions?  OK, say goodbye to your industry.  We're moving all of our orders to the Banana Republic of Tropico, where workers are whipped if they don't work at least 12 hours a day for 6 pennies and lodging in a cardboard box.  That's the *practical* reality of globalization."
b"Any union that exists now is a nationalist or fascist union if we are to follow a truly communist or socialist society.\n\nIf you think your local union is a good thing its only a good thing for people that are near you or look like you.

b"Of course. I think we need to question our relationship with the CCp after this is done. However, Chinese citizens themselves aren't responsible and we must ensure that anything we do doesn't have further implications for them. They don't deserve this. Perhaps we'll even see political change in other nations, who knows."
b"True, but when we have Americans stranded on a ship off our shore because he's unwilling to take the temporary jump in cases - it very much is about him.\n\n..and the apparent lack of the 5th grade education required to understand exponential growth and how paltry those numbers will look in another week or so."

b'>I assume the difference between Ecclesiastical Latin and Classical Latin lies in things like "v" being pronounced "v" or "w" and such?\n\nIt\'s a bit more than that. Ecclesiastical Latin follows Italian pronunciation, so things like ce/ci become che/chi, like when you hear him say \'\'pace\'\' as \'\'pache\'\'. He also said \'\'ma**g**ister\'\' as in \'\'jacket\'\'. Ecclesiastical Latin is an artificial pronunciation created by the church.   \n\n\nIn Classical Latin c is always /k/, therefore \'\'pace\'\' would be pronounced \'\'pake\'\', and the g is always a hard /g/ as in \'\'ghost\'\', therefore, magister would be pronounced differently. You also have a 3rd pronunciation called scientific Latin, which is 99% Classical except for the V, which is pronounced just like in Ecclesiastical to differentiate it from the vowel U.  \n\n\nPersonally, I dislike Ecclesiastical Latin as it sounds horrible to pronounce Latin like that.'

I\'ve been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria...there is little I haven\'t been exposed to in my profession. And with notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared.\n\nI am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.\n\nWhat I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they " probably don\'t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know..." and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess.\n\nI am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you even  \nimagine?\n\nI\'m scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession.\n\nBut mostly, I\'m scared about what message we are telling our kids when faced with a threat. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.\n\nCovid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it. Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and "fight for yourself above all else" attitude could prove disastrous.\n\nI implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let\'s meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.\n\nFacts not fear. Clean hands. Open hearts.  \nOur children will thank us for it.'

b"Except it's not a Pandemic... A quick google search verifies that this is not the case.   \n\n\nAs defined, a Pandemic is a disease prevalent over a whole country or the world. Prevalent meaning widespread.  \n\n\nSo, a disease that is widespread over an entire country, or all over the world. Yes, there are clusters of cases in different countries, but it is far from being wide spread over the entire countries, and definitely not widespread over the entire world.  \n\n\nIs Cancer a Pandemic?

b'Who cannot use the term "pandemic" because there is no definition in this sense in their procedures. They are now referring to the event as "a major global emergency". Basically, it\'s just semantics.\n\nRegarding CNN... They are right to use the layman term "pandemic" but let\'s not kid ourselves: they DO have ulterior motives. The administration\'s response was abysmal, so underlining the severity of the situation and posting it against the ineptitude of the authorities is a very direct way of injuring the GOP. Don\'t get me wrong, the essence is right in what CNN is doing and reporting, but I have a reasonable doubt that their approach would have been similar had the US had a Democratic administration.'

b'According to stats around 10% of Covid patients need intensive care, mostly because they need machines to breathe/keep them alive. A friend of mine works in a medium sized hospital. She stated they had oxygen at every hospital bed, but only around 30 respiratory support machines. And just 4 of those machines that mix oxygen into your blood directly if your lungs are shutting down completely.  She is psychiatrist, but they are getting crash courses to care for patients with SARS, freeing beds, postponing all non urgent treatments and are preparing the psychiatric ward for Corona patients.\n\nShe said, they have no covid cases yet, but when those 30 ICU beds are full, they will have to decide who lives and who will slowly suffocate to death. She is really scared and stressed. There are no covid deaths in Germany yet, but if the ICUs are full, death toll will ramp up just like in northern Italy. \n\nAnd that\'s the main reason progress must be slowed. We only have a limited number of hospitals, doctors, nurses and ICUs.\n\nEdit: The psych ward beds are no hospital beds and don\'t have oxygen of course. But they would be in charge for non-compliant "less cooperative" infected patients (drug them and restrain) and for terminally ill patients / palliative care for patients sorted out due to triage. "We are not allowed to kill patients. I mean, you put your dog to sleep if he is beyond recovery to do him a last favour, but we aren\'t allowed to do that. People with SARS and without ventilation will slowly suffocate to death. I have been told to think about a way to medicate them to ease their suffering and panic, but my medication can not be the cause of their death. By god, if it was me I would tell them to OD me morphines, but no, I have to suffocate myself to death, like drowning in slow motion. Because law...I can\'t be your cause of death. Nature has to be. Your death has to be aaaaall natural, no added chemicals..."\n\nShe\'s getting really cynical. I have never seen her like that. She is venting to me. I am scared shirtless and can\'t sleep. But for her it has to be ten times worse so I listen.'

There's a psychological term for this, damn I wish I remembered it.

b"I don't know why you're getting down voted. You've summed it up so well but I guess people don't want to listen to reason."
b"According to *your number*, covid-19 is 20x deadlier than the flu, at 0.1% mortality rate.  The flu does not land 10-20% of infected in the hospital for weeks, either.  The US has over 550 cases, and the only people getting tested are those with heavy symptoms and travel history.  *Nurses on the front line* can't get tested.  So if 80% of infected are too mild to get tested, that means about 2750 people are actually infected, and spreading.\n\nRational thinkers aren't worried about mass graves--we're looking at health care and services getting overwhelmed."

b'Do you know what respiratory means? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a hint: it has to do with a fucking important organ system you fucking idiot'
b"I'm not worried much for myself. I'm young and relatively healthy. I'll almost certainly be fine even if I get it. But it can and has been deadly for older populations and those with weaker immune systems (think cancer patients undergoing chemo and HIV positive patients). And it could be real bad for those that already have lung issues such as COPD. \n\nBut it's also a novel form of respiratory virus. We don't know everything about it and it is spreading and spreading fast. We don't need to outright panic, but we need to take it seriously - even if you aren't part of the most susceptible populations you should be taking precautions to protect yourself so that you don't pass it on to them."
b"It's hilarious that the WHO still hasn't declared it a pandemic. At this point they shouldn't even bother; it'll only draw attention to the fact that they missed the boat by a country mile."

b'I think something everyone needs to learn is how to know the difference between taking something seriously and going into a panic. If people are told to take something seriously, too many jump to "stop trying to scare me and make me panic!" That\'s not always the goal.'
b"Wait until the virus starts popping up in nearby cities and counties, then people are going to really listen. I've seen the sentiment at my workplace, live in Oregon, go from it's fine it's less than a cold just cover up and wash hands, to I'm only going out as needed.

b"Do you know what exponential growth means? In case you don't I'll put it in words for you. \n\nEvery 6 days the amount of infected people multiplies by 10. give it 2 weeks and it has multiplied by 100, 3 weeks and it has multiplied by 1000. In a month thats 10000.\n\nLooks pretty scary to me."
b'The problem with being too dumb to realize how stupid you are, is that you think the people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t as dumb are the stupid ones. Pro tip: the experts in the field aren\xe2\x80\x99t the dumb ones here.'
b'When should we call it? \n\nAlso, these \xe2\x80\x9cidiots\xe2\x80\x9d are doctors and scientists who have studied viruses their whole life.\n\nTell me more how you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert in this please.'
b'Pandemic Phase 6: Community-level outbreaks are in at least one additional country in a different WHO region from phase 5. A global pandemic is under way.'
b'To add in, if the curve goes above the capacity line, a lot more people start dying. The longer the curve is above the capacity line, the more people die. \n\nA simple scenario is that hospitals run out of spare ventilators. People who could be saved with this support (including people who are sick for other reasons) would die in that case.\n\n(I think New York State has around 5,000 ventilators in regular use, with around 1,500 in storage for emergencies. Going by 20% of people getting sick needing vents, all that spare capacity gets eaten up if less than 10,000 people get sick at once.)'
b'I hate that this is the image that\'s going around. Hubei\'s healthcare system was overwhelmed at less than 1% of cases, doing a bit of simple math reveals that every other healthcare system in the world gets overwhelmed somewhere between 0.1% and 1% cases. So if you\'re going to draw this graph, draw it with the peak 20 - 50x higher and the "best case" scenario being the healthcare system overwhelmed for a full year.\n\nThe only solution is to bend the R0 curve down severely so at most 1% of your population gets infected. The Chinese themselves said every 5 days of inaction, your situation gets 3x worse. You can say "China lies" all you want but if you\'re not even willing to accept the truthful stuff coming out of China, what use is there even to China lying?'
b'We need people like her speaking out to those in charge both politically and those that run medical facilities, as well as to the general public. \n\nIt might be too late, but if only we could start building emergency facilities as well as getting American factories to ramp up creation of ventilators and things for repertory health!'
b'Liberals are just as anti science too when it fits their world view. The left is more concerned with "dont be a bigot" than effective quarantine measures.'
b'Talking about the US here. Last I checked CNN was in the USA.'
b'Got a link? That\xe2\x80\x99s Fucking outrages'
b"You're going to need to source that one."
b'Came here to same the same. Great minds think alike?\n\nAnyway, the term pandemic does not indicate severity in detail. We are definitely in pandemic land now, but there still have been more severe pandemics in the past (according to what we know AT THIS TIME about covid 19).\n\nSource: [Doctor Explains How to Prepare for a Pandemic (WIRED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr1aXn8_F3I)'
b'There are 117000 affected people over the course of 3 months over the WHOLE world, with most of them being in china. Is that an exceptionaly high proportion of the population? Are you fucking serious right now?'
b'How is 0.0015% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population an exceptionally high proportion of the population?'
b'[deleted]'
b'Yep. Very good observation. People here are definitely way over the top. Which I find entertaining.'
b"To be fair, they're being played by like 10 different groups with as many different reasons for terrifying the public."
b'I have zero doubt that this will absolutely blow up in the US, but using the term pandemic is not correct right now.'
b'3000 deaths on a planet with 7.5 billion people. 98% survival rate. Bodies are not piling up. It\xe2\x80\x99s a respiratory virus. Chances are if you get it you won\xe2\x80\x99t even know it and it won\xe2\x80\x99t feel different than any cold.'

b'"It\'s but a flesh wound."'
b'You ever had the common cold? A cough? That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what this is. You can be a coward and live in fear and buy into media propaganda all you want. They\xe2\x80\x99ll take your money. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Spanish flu or bubonic plague. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the fucking idiot?'
b'It is likely because of the \xe2\x80\x9cWorld Bank Pandemic Bond\xe2\x80\x9d ( https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/06/28/world-bank-launches-first-ever-pandemic-bonds-to-support-500-million-pandemic-emergency-financing-facility ) that will pay back money to investors in June 15 2020 if there has not been any pandemics since it started in 2017, they will wait until then most likely. \n\nIf they declare a pandemic most or all of that money goes to helping countries that has a hard time but the investors will lose money.'
b"They're refusing to call it that to avoid global panic. \n\nWhich honestly makes sense. This entire experience only highlights how ridiculously people behave in these scenarios."
b"WHO states it has to reach all 7 continents for definition of pandemic. \n\nUntil it reaches Antarctica it won't ever be."
b"Exactly. There's a huge gap between being well informed and making precautions, and sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is okay. Calling it a pandemic is not 'alarmist'. Informing people about the virus and its effects around the world is not 'alarmist'. But too many people would rather just plug their ears."
b'Yes. I work as a truck loader and we deal with electronic car antennas that come from Vietnam. There are no confirmed cases here, but there are in Vietnam. So I asked if we could have a meeting to talk about this outbreak and how we should take extra precautions.\n\nImmediately I was declined because it\'s "all over the news" and " everyone already knows" and "to just wash your hands" and "no need to cause panic".\n\nI hate to say it, but with how easily people turn a blind eye to such a global incident, some are just begging for trouble.'
b'Honestly I thought the same thing, untill my brother and his wife decided to spontaneously take a trip to San Francisco this weekend. Ya know, the city with the Grand Princess? They sent me pictures and thought it was funny. His wife is an ER nurse.'
b"It's in more than 80 countries."
b'All of us have a superiority complex. Not a severe one, but still'
b"Depends on the sub really. Some subs are really niche and it's not very Yahoo Answers. As Reddits really become more popular in the past couple years, the general subs have gotten much more Yahoo Answers.\n\nr/Coronavirus just has already reached the point where it's attracting more of the Yahoo Answers crowd."
b"My more conspiracy minded acquaintances claim the whole thing is made up. It's just a bad cold being turned into something more so the government can seize power, companies can sell the eventual vaccine, rich people can make money using it to manipulate the stock market, and/or the Left is using it to steal the election from Trump. \n\n(Note these are not all conservatives. Liberal conspiracists tend to see it as stock market manipulation while the conservative ones see it as a political attack)."
b"People need to take it seriously but not panic. If you get it, wear a mask to prevent it from spreading airborn(if possible, not fully caught up on it) and have consistent hand washing. It's not the worst thing that could hit but it's definitely not a good thing or something minor."
b"> Trump's denial of it being a pandemic\n\nTrump's not the one denying that it's a pandemic - the CDC/WHO are. Trump is saying it's just a cold and that like a miracle, it'll disappear before April."
b"The definition is pretty straight forward. I'm not sure why more people aren't using the term pandemic."
b'they have the former surgeon general'
b"i mean... if it fits the definition of a pandemic i trust that it's a pandemic..."
b'Please be civil and respectful. Insulting other users, racism, and low effort toxicity are not allowed in comments or posts.'

b"For some reason comparing healthcare to a Ferrari doesn't sit well with me. And to be honest, a Ferrari isn't really that good at being a car. It goes fast sure, but a Toyota Corolla will trump it in every other category."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s what every government tells its people, it\xe2\x80\x99s very strange to hear when someone believes it.\n\nMy country\xe2\x80\x99s myth, hammered in since primary school, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re the richest; only that we\xe2\x80\x99re not.'

b'Hi do you have any examples on who he has removed so far, to drain the swamp?'
b">The swamp is being exposed on a regular basis & people are being removed.\n\nI'm confused, who has been removed? The swamp has only gotten murkier by the presence of Trump and his entourage. I'm not sure how you can really say that."
b'Good God you people are stupid.'
b'Except he brought in his that are corrupt to run or in some cases purposefully mismanage those departments. But facts are irrelevant to you'
b'Was discussing this with our trauma attending Saturday. She summed it up concisely: access, quality, cost. Prioritize one, the others suffer. \n\nUS: prioritizes quality. While everyone has "access", cost per patient is among the the highest.\n\nCanada: prioritizes cost. Quality is good, but access has suffered.\n\nBritian: prioritizes access at expense of quality\n\netc...'

b'Please avoid off-topic political discussions.\n\nOur policy on political posts is as follows:\n\nThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned.'

b'You do realize they make more money, with ALIVE people right?'
b"It's 100% because accepting reality would make Trump look bad.\n\nCan you imagine what they would be saying now if Obama was president? Remember Ebola?\n\nUntil recently Fox News (at least the website) had been almost *entirely* silent on Coronavirus, except for the odd story framed to make a liberal look unhinged."

b"What rates did you use? Because while results I've found indicate it COULD be higher, they vary dramatically, and seem wildly unreliable."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I followed the last part there; what is the \xe2\x80\x98this\xe2\x80\x99 that the WHO is driving?'
b"The pandemic bonds have nothing to do with what the WHO calls it. There are specific criteria based on spread and deaths in countries. They haven't paid out because none of the eligible countries (all developing nations) have sufficient deaths yet.\n\nAnd frankly, the pandemic bonds are absolute peanuts compared to how much the markets have been shedding."

b"You're arguing with a Russian troll bot FYI."
b'Or he might just be a troll.'
b"> To add in, if the curve goes above the capacity line, a lot more people start dying.\n\nThey don't just die from COVID-19. They start dying of completely unrelated things because manpower and equipment is tied up dealing with the infected."
b'A lot of hospitals have shut down in recent years. Maybe some of these should be reopened on an emergency basis?  Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia comes to mind. I am sure there are others.'
b'There are no numbers on the pic for a reason I think. It brings across a very simple message in a REALLY easy to understand way\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0and I think that is a huge achievement and exactly what we need. Also, if you\xe2\x80\x98d make it more scary, people would start resisting the message. Some people invest a lot of emotional eneergy right now so that they don\xe2\x80\x98t need to be afraid\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 and no matter what you think of that, you still need their cooperation to, well, flatten the curve.'
b"I don't understand your criticism. This conveys the current strategy to prevent the current healthcare system being overwhelmed. The goal is slow the rate of case build up. \n\nIs your point that there is no hope and that everything is doom and gloom?"
b'Well, yes, they are a company based in the US. But you are aware that they report on global news? And this is a global pandemic? I think you should look up the definition of the word pandemic.'
b"Thank you. People seem to think that there's about 2 *million* on earth. A few thousand is the smallest drop in the bucket imaginable"
b'I think you e confused yourself. He is saying cnn making it a pandemic will make it less credible. I am saying that his satire post was perfectly impersonating someone who solely watches Fox News and Sean Hannity.\n\nThe trump voter that already thinks Cnn fakenews will see this as an attempt at \xe2\x80\x9cdems trying to cause coronavirus fear\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the accurate classification that it is. \n\nAka his original comment is valid: the more people believe it\xe2\x80\x99s just fear mongering dems, whether what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is true or false, the less serious a large portion of the population will treat the virus.'

b'Oh, alright then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ignore the WHO, leading virologists and epidemiologists, and every single medical professional in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran because u/stickycheetofingers has ensured me that it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse than a cold. The arrogance.'
b'Do you not understand that every single disease that\xe2\x80\x99s ever existed starts from 1 and increases from there? At some point, there were fewer than 500 people with the Black Plague, too.'
b"The flu and common cold are endemic, not pandemics. This is because they are already fully established in the population. If they were newly spreading they would be pandemics. Don't comment on things you are clearly clueless about."
b'>You ever had the common cold? A cough? That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what this is.\n\nYou should really read the reports of some infected.\n\nThere was a "mild" case report from Italy, he wrote about feeling like drowning for over a week. He said it was hell on earth and he did\'t get admitted to hospital because he wasn\'t severe enough.\n\nYes there are a lot of people for whom it really is "just like a common cold", they make up 50% to 80% of cases. But for the rest it gets really bad.'
b'10-20% of people need hospitalization. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x99s as mild as the common cold.'
b'If you look at the conditions needed for those bonds to go into effect, it has nothing to do with the declaration. Its all about confirmed cases and spread (which is probably why governments are trying to not test).'
b'So basically the purpose of the bond was pointless because of greed'
b"So a few things.\n\n1) wasn't aware of this, kind of fucking morbid.\n\n2) this quote has *not* aged well;\n\n>World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim\xc2\xa0said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are **moving away from** *the cycle of panic and neglect that has characterized so much of our approach to pandemics.* We are leveraging our capital market expertise, our deep understanding of the health sector, our experience overcoming development challenges, and our strong relationships with donors and the insurance industry to serve the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest people. This creates an entirely new market for pandemic risk insurance. Drawing on lessons from the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, the Facility will help improve health security for everyone. I especially want to thank the World Health Organization and the governments of Japan and Germany for their support in launching this new mechanism.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'This is inaccurate. The terms of the bond are not dependent upon any official declaration of pandemic.  They are called in based upon specific metrics.\n\nhttp://www.bifurcatedneedle.com/new-blog/2019/10/8/understanding-the-mechanics-of-the-pandemic-emergency-financing-facility\n\nhttp://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/882831509568634367/PEF-Final-Prospectus-PEF.pdf'

b'Are the CDC and WHO truly independent?\n\nSerious question.'
b"He's probably mixing a few things he's heard. There are two strains of coronavirus that are endemic and cause seasonal colds. And for most people COVID-19 will just be a mild or moderate chest cold. \n\nColds, including coronavirus ones, do seem to be seasonal so it may well die down this summer -- but then reappear in the Fall. It also might not be seasonal, we won't know until this summer. \n\nIf it is seasonal that gives us a chance to stop it. Widespread testing and isolation of people who might catch it during the summer could stop it. But I suspect it has spread to countries that can't or won't do that and we'll get the strain again from somewhere like India or Nigeria or South Africa. Or even the US."
b"Because the CDC/WHO type orgs use a definition that it has to reach all 7 continents.... And it hasn't reached Antartica... It's utterly ridiculous.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fefj9n/im_dr_john_torres_medical_correspondent_for_nbc/fjnwkus/"
b"That's an outdated definition (over 10 years old)\xe2\x80\x94they don't follow that anymore. They use a more nuanced definition now."
b"He's being a bit sensationalist about it but CNN is known for creating their own narrative rather than reporting facts.\n\nRemember how they tried to cover up the Hillary email leak by saying that it was illegal for regular people to read the emails and to only listen to what they said about it instead."
b'CNN Has also edited the skin colors of some US candidates (specifically Bernie Sanders) to make them look less appealing on screen and decrease their popularity.

b'It\'s the most simple comparison I could think of. "The best" and "the most accessible" are different categories. You could say the US has the best medical system and also says it\'s the least accessible, because best has more to do with quality of the care than whether or not it\'s attainable. \n\nI\'m sure there are countries out there that have free healthcare that can\'t afford high tech medical equipment, experimental or expensive drugs and don\'t have enough highly trained surgical staff to do all necessary operations and surgeries. That would be accessible care, but poor care.\n\nAlso let me iterate that a Corolla doesn\'t trump a Ferrari in any category except price and fuel mileage... lol.'
b'Hey, as long as you count debt and interest payments by debt slaves as economic activity the US economy is the biggest. Sure, 20% of our economy is interest payments and fees, 12% is medical services, billing, and denial of services, and most of our wealth is held by a tiny minority actively trying to turn Americans into debt slaves, but that 1% is REALLY rich.'

b'Well if this hits Congress due to the utter failure of our CDC and federal government to contain or mitigate it, and taking into account the age demographics in Congress, he very well may drain 50% or more of the swamp, indiscriminately.  \n\nAnd by "drain", I mean they\'ll be dead.

b"I agree.  It's kind of the old do you want it fast, cheap or quality?  Pick two."
b'I would disagree with this statement. It\'s all general stuff without any sources. I\'m from Canada. I had a heart attack a couple of years ago. I went into emergency and in less than 3 hours after entering the hospital, I was waking up from a angioplasty. They had put in a stent in one my arteries. My heart suffered at most 5% effectiveness. It cost me nothing. The only paper I had to sign was a standard liability form.\n\nThe hospital where they performed on me has a world leading cardiology Dept. They have invented procedures used by cardiologist all over the world. \n\nI got great quality (10 out of 10) and no extra cost to me. \n\nAccess for non life threatening procedures can be improved upon for sure in Canada.  It better or worse depending on what you need and where you are. \n\nIn the case of COVID-19, Canadians are not scared to go get tested for fear of having to pay for tests. They get tested even if they didn\'t visit the "hot" countries. Did I mention that Canada had testing available for the first patient in late January? Local hospital testing which was then verified by the federal lab. The federal lab equivalent to CDC lab wasn\'t rejecting tests. The whole world had information on how to build tests and most of the countries started to prepare for it as soon as they got the info. For anyone with a brain knew that it was a matter of time when the virus would reach every country. It\'s WHEN and not IF. \n\nSo how can a country that focuses on cost be more prepared than a country that focuses on quality. Because to make these statements is ridiculous. Sorry for the long rant.'

b'Ok, so you unlock the door and then? Doctors, nurses and supply chains magically poof out of thin air?'
b'I\'m sure these things are being considered (as well as using lots of other spaces temporarily for non-critical patients), all of which will push the "capacity line" up, but we\'ll still hard limits on other things, like health care workers (who can get sick, too), vents, supplies, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that epidemics are on an exponential growth curve, while health care resources are at best linear.'
b'Except all the worry about not being extreme enough has done is made people complacent about the upcoming risk. \n\nThis is the same logic as the messaging around "We\'re going to tell people mask are completely useless because if they realize they actually help, we\'re going to run out of them."\n\nIntentionally lying to your populace about easily verifiable information is corrosive to the public trust necessary to get us through the next epidemic.'
b'The area under the curve is equal in both scenarios which implies that we can gain a lot by simply slowing down the rate of infection. Given that the peak of the curve is just 2x above capacity, this feels like a doable, high impact intervention.\n\nThe reality is, with uncontrolled spread, the peak is going to be 20 - 50x above capacity and spreading it out more is merely going to bring it down to 5 - 10x above capacity for a whole year or more. The highest impact intervention we have now is to *reduce* the peak, not delay it. If we delay without reducing, everyone is gonna have a lot worse of a time than this pretty graph implies.'
b"Can you imagine how many asymptomatic people are carrying the virus right now? How many people that haven't been tested? You'd have to be a fool to believe that only 110,000 people are infected right now. The Iranian government is downplaying everything connected to the virus, scientists and researchers agree there is no way only 7,110 people are infected and 237 have died, calculations and analysis show there are probably around 20,000 thousand people infected and deaths most likely in the thousands. That alone would raise cases to 131,000 worldwide."

b'> The last time the WHO declared a global pandemic was the outbreak of H1N1, otherwise known as\xc2\xa0swine flu, in 2009. At the time, swine flu had infected close to 30,000 people across 74 countries. As of Tuesday\xc2\xa0morning, for comparison, Covid-19 had infected over 79,000 people across 28 countries, with 2,069 cases reported outside of China.\n\n> Labelling H1N1 a pandemic was controversial, however. The WHO\xc2\xa0defined\xc2\xa0the term simply as a \xe2\x80\x9cworldwide spread of a new disease.\xe2\x80\x9d Critics later\xc2\xa0noted\xc2\xa0that WHO officials lowered the organization\xe2\x80\x99s criteria for\xc2\xa0defining\xc2\xa0a pandemic shortly beforehand.\n\n> Previously, a viral outbreak\xe2\x80\x99s mortality rate had to reach a certain level\xe2\x80\x94in addition to contagion going international\xe2\x80\x94for it to qualify for the pandemic label. Facing a lack of consensus on the proper definition of the word, the WHO appears to have done away with the word \xe2\x80\x9cpandemic\xe2\x80\x9d altogether, at least in its official terminology.\n\n\nhttps://fortune.com/2020/02/25/coronavirus-pandemic-who/'

b'CNN is not nearly as left leaning as people think. They also did a shit ton to protect the bush administration. Their problem is not that they are politically motivated, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they are profit motivated and they are lazy. They never do investigative reporting and rarely take an editorialized stance on anything. They do surface level reporting as fast as possible, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fact check, they figure out whatever narrative will make them to most money and they go with it. \n\nOnly with the Trump impeachment have I seen them start to take any sort of stance on politics as opposed to just quickly showing both sides as if they\xe2\x80\x99re even, but they still had plenty of trump defenders on even though they would grill them much more harshly. However this was a rarity and the thing that conservatives never realize is liberals hate cnn just as much as the right does. \n\nYou have news outlets like the New York Times, MSNBC, and, to a much lesser extent, NPR which are all much more left leaning than CNN but they are all much more trustworthy news outlets in the sense of if they are reporting something then it\xe2\x80\x99s much less likely to be a false or non impactful story. Their skew just comes from which accurate stories they choose to run. \n\nPeople who analyze the trustworthiness and political leanings is different news outlets always put CNN as moderately untrustworthy but centrist.'

b'It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. First, there is plenty of data on the WHO website, although most of it is Influenza-related. That\xe2\x80\x99s the pandemic everyone was waiting for. Not that people weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting or planning for an outbreak of a novel virus, there\xe2\x80\x99s been plans for that too - but it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to plan, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know in advance what kind of virus it will be and how it will behave. SARS-CoV-2 is a nastier one (in terms of contagiousness versus mortality) than most assumptions would\xe2\x80\x99ve been previously. \n\nAnd that said, the influenza documentation still provides plenty of useful information for the current situation, just not always 1-to-1 applicable. \n\nSecond, as with any transnational governing body, it leaves public exposure mostly to the member states, ie the ones with the higher (democratic) legitimacy. By nature, it must work mostly behind the scenes, coordinating (but not dictating) policy, and streamlining information flows between countries. \n\nAnd of course, specific measures must be different from place to place - even within countries. But there is a large similarity in responses - just look at the travel advice almost all countries are giving now. Italy has gone for the Wuhan model in response to it\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak in Lombardy. Most other European countries follow the initial Italian response. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s party due to coordination from the ECDC, but they in turn coordinate with WHO.'
b'I said what my point was multiple times in that text..'
b'Chances are if your wife, friends, parents & siblings *all* got it they still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die. Pandemics happen. People do get sick and do die but freaking out about it isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping anyone.'
b"First,i dont even technically considered a broken window fallacy. But regardless No, because the money spent by the retirees or their caretakers is USED to employ someone else. Older people naturally get sick, how many nurses, doctors, hospice, and other various caretakers do you think currently make their living on the fact the elderly simply EXIST and need care? They feed their families with that income, kids go to school. I dont see how the BWF applies. It does not make sense for a fully developed capitalist nation to shoot itself in the foot by eliminating the elderly, in ANY way. That's like killing the sick and making healthcare workers unemployed...guys, it's not that hard to understand."
b'Thanks for humoring me, I agree it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m inherently a skeptic, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t tend to believe something is happening unless I see proof. But it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible the WHO has been coordinating behind the scenes and most countries are just choosing to ignore them.'
b"Add a million sick people and the drop barely changes. I'd estimate at something like 100 million *deaths* and I'd consider it a pandemic. I don't know if deaths of cases should be used as the reasoning to call it a pandemic. The way I think about it, If 100 million got sick, about 2-5 million would die. Not that much when compared to 7 billion. Still just a drop"
b'Chances are if my aging parents got it, they have a very real risk of premature death.\n\nMy dude, an aversion to potentially lethal infectious diseases is a natural and vital instinct. You are trying to stigmatize a rational alarmist reaction as \xe2\x80\x9cfreaking out\xe2\x80\x9d. Failure of this instinct can put you and your community in an avoidable life or death situation.\n\nArrogance and ignorance on a massive scale will be the leading cause of death in this pandemic, same as the Spanish flu. Our society is so sheltered that we think we\xe2\x80\x99re immune to things like plagues, famines, and natural disasters. It\xe2\x80\x99s causing us to ignore our natural instincts and stigmatize people with a totally normal reaction. We will see much death that could\xe2\x80\x99ve been easily avoided had we taken action two months ago. As usual, our hubris is our downfall.'
b"If those old rich people died their money would still be used, hopefully for something more useful.  It's not like their money would disappear."
b'On the contrary, they\xe2\x80\x99re being applied. Just compare the COVID19 guidelines issued by the CDC and the ECDC. Different formats, but suspiciously similar language. Which points to both those documents being wrappers around WHO guidelines. \n\nAgain, implementation on the ground can (and should) be different, depending on where the epidemic is in that specific region. Wait for Wuhan- and Lombardy style quarantines to come to a country near you. It really is a matter of time.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not being arrogant. You should be aware just not overly concerned. Wash your hands, go about your life. What else can you do? Worst case scenario 2% of the worlds pop dies from this. Highly unlikely. It will be widespread, a vaccine will be developed, herd immunity will be gained, life will go on. \n    The biggest danger and threat to life is from socioeconomic collapse from people overreacting.'

b"In fairness, I think most politicians go into it really thinking they'll make a difference.  However, once they get in they find they are not permitted to vote freely on bills.  They are all but physically forced to vote along party lines no matter how they personally feel about a bill.  The party will simply threaten to pull all support from the politician's next election if they don't vote along party lines.  Only a few politicians have the actual political clout among the electorate to embolden them to vote freely (e.g. Mitt Romney, John McCain).  In practice the republican party is far more guilty of this than the democratic party."

b'Maybe since he is a dentist he could figure out that the cuts made to the CDC were a bad idea?

b"Fatality rate is. 0.5-3.5%, not the 60-80% that the Bubonic plague had...\n\nHumans found a way. We are still here. \n\nMitigation of spread is also less about never getting sick and more about spreading out *when* people get sick so we don't overwhelm hospitals."

b'You are not wrong. But there are people in this thread that are happy he might have the coronavirus, that goes beyond political.'
b'Agreed. Its not about stopping the virus, its already here. Its more about slowing the spread of it as much as possible, until they come up with a vaccine.\n\nEveryone has a responsibility to do that.'
b'Agreed. I was talking about your more general sentiment, not the outlook specifically on coronavirus. The idea that humans are inventive and resilient is correct, but will not protect us from a truly terrible pandemic, unlucky astroid strike, etc. The dustbin of history is filled with unlucky species.'
b"That's something I see people miss, alot.\n\nLet's say this pandemic will, in fact, infect 70% of the global population.\n\nIf that number gets infected at once, a spike on the graph, hospitals get overwhelmed and fatalities are unnecessarily high.\n\nIf we mitigate transmission a much as possible, and that 70% gets sick over 8 months instead, the hospitals will be busy but will be able to mostly handle the flow, resulting in many critical cases getting a bed, and getting care they wouldn't get otherwise."

b'I work in a package sorting facility. And they told us today if were sick stay home. But I really doubt any of us working there can afford to take time off. Plus there is no insurance or anything, so we cant afford to go to the doctors. No sick time yet. Were taking precautions like gloves and washing hands, keeping an eye on our hubs and infected cities....But Idk.....We sort and send packages all over america......sketches me out thinking about how fast a sick person coming in carrying it could spread it'
b'Why not just put it into law.  Two weeks paid sick leave a year would cover most cases.  It\xe2\x80\x99d help stop the spread of the flu I suspect,not just Coronavirus.'
b'>Employers: PLEASE understand giving your employees flexibility and (paid) sick leave will save you money in the long run- it\xe2\x80\x99s much cheaper than shutting down because everyone else gets sick!\n\nEmployer: give our low wage employees paid sick leave?  What next, contribute to their "retirement" fund?  What do peasants need to retire for anyway? *puffs on cigar*'
b'Reading all these comments as a European who has actual functioning sick leave systems and safety nets that allow these kind of things is frightening...\n\nAmericans are basically screwed.\n\nI can call in sick right now and get paid for the first 7 days of my sick leave from my employer.\n\nAfter those 7 days the government takes over paying my sick days for the next 7 days at 100% my wage.\n\nAnd even after those combined 2 weeks i still have sick leave but it falls to 85% of my wage paid out.'
b'Employees PLEASE stay home if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick. We have paid sick leave and our employees still regularly come to work while sick. The other day my coworker looked so pale. Was coughing and sneezing. Put his coat on in the building (very out of character for him) which makes me think he had the chills and maybe a fever. \n\nThe next day another coworker developed a nasty cough. Now the girl that sits next to me texted me today saying she\xe2\x80\x99s got a bad cough and fever. Luckily she has the brains to call off sick.\n\nEdit: To those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have paid sick time. That fucking sucks.

b'Good luck with that. Sick days in America are looked as you can\xe2\x80\x99t come in to make us money. Too many days off equals goodbye.'
b'Heres how this is going to shake out\n\nEvery american employer is going to send down a pretty little announcement or email from the top "taking the pandemic very seriously and working with the public health department" yadda yadda. They will say "If you\'re sick, please stay home and look after your health" - maybe comment on how pandemics are only contained by how strong the public is at looking after themselves.\n\nAnd that\'s it. When nobody goes home because it\'s either work your shitty job for your shitty pay or not make rent, a lot of moral rules get bent.\n\nAnd then after that, when infections continue to exponentially climb, company execs will just shrug and say they did the best they could.'
b"Most won't.  They'll insist their workers work until they are literally gasping for breath.  Workers are replaceable, they aren't worth investing money in."
b'USA - the country where the government begs the employers to give paid sick leave instead of enforcing it via law.\n\nMost countries in Europe have unrestricted sick leave + protecting the employee from being fired due to being sick. Oh, not to forget the universal healthcare.'

b'No employer, *ESPECIALLY* Walmart, is going to support this.'
b"Not everyone can just stay home sick. Where I work we get almost a month of sick time a year (you can work up to this and save it up unless you just take sick time a a lot).\n\nIf one person is sick, sure but if my whole office caught this virus and we all stayed home my company would effectively shutdown.\n\nHigher ups have the ability to work from home but we just have the infrastructure to do that and it just isn't feasible with what I do.\n\nSame goes for factory workers or people in a warehouse, etc. The idea of working from home is great until you realize who can actually do it.\n\nI realize this is about staying home and using sick time, but once someone realizes they have this virus they've already spread it around. The issue is testing. We all need to be tested before we pass it to someone else. What will happen is that I'll stay home sick with coronavirus but everyone I've been around will have been exposed and the they will have to stay home sick from work. This cycle will continue.\n\nAnyone that thinks they will just not catch this is disillusioned."
b'Employers can\xe2\x80\x99t support this if it crashes their cash flow.  There are breaking points.  Businesses are not endless money buckets that can afford to pay lots of people while they are shut down, when their customers are cancelling orders or avoiding new purchases.  When they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cash to pay the mortgage, utilities, invoices for inventory,  they also can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the wages.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of what they want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they can do.  We should be prepared to see emergency financing facilities like in previous crises and it will be a shit show of people screaming about bailouts and who gets them.'

b'Look at Singapore healthcare and work system. Might not be applicable for big countries like US but at least take some reference to it. While some form of financial freedom might not be there, it helps tide through crisis like this.'

b'You know what else they should do? Send Army Corps of Engineers to build field hospital near major city, at least at Seattle and New York. I am afraid people will need those soon.'

b'it is like telling a 3 year old to brush their teeth without supervising them.'
b'De he forget this is America?  Companies dont care aboit workers.'
b"My sick days are PTO which I don't get much of as it is.  There have been dozens of emails sent out telling us to stay home but most of people either used it all or didn't have it to begin with.  And our company does not allow time off without pay."
b'In America? HAHAHAHAHAH!'
b'The official stance from the company I work for. "If you have sick day\'s, or vacation use them". Otherwise the attendance policy will be the same. 3 absences and you\'re terminated.'

b"You don't go to work, they cut your paycheck."
b'You gonna pay me?'
b'If sick -> don\'t go to work???\n\nImagine if PSAs were like this. "If you smoke, then don\'t." "If you\'re depressed, just be happy." Oh man you really solved my problem there with that one.'
b'Exactly what symptoms should we be looking out for? I saw one thing say runny nose, sore throat, fever, and cough, somewhere else just said cough and fever'
b"Basically what should happen is this. If you test positive for Corona from a verified doctor, then the government must enforce you don't go to work for 14 days and pay you for those days."
b"It's insane that the government has to ask nicely for employers to comply with this overly polite request. This should be mandated by law, it should not be an option for employers to either explicitly pressure sick people to come in, or to not give them sick pay so they are forced to choose between being able to pay rent or staying in bed. How the fuck is this normal?"
b'Narrator:  "They didn\'t."'
b'Employers: LOL'
b'We need to Expand Unemployment to cover quarantines!'
b'Everyone has to make a living.'
b'"Please" isn\'t going to get anyone very far.\n\nStronger measures should be taken.\n\nIf some fast food manager knowingly makes a sick person come in to work, that should be a prison sentence for them and a huge fine for the owner.\n\nNot just because of the coronavirus, but for communicable diseases in general.'
b'Were it so easy'
b'Finally - some sense from the authorities.'
b"I worked an entire shift with a 104\xc2\xb0 fever when I was a bartender,  because I didn't have a choice.  We bartenders ran the whole bar alone, and were not allowed to call in sick. We did not get PTO or sick leave...if we wanted time off, we got someone to cover for us and we didn't get paid for it.  \n\nNo one was willing to cover for me last minute (fever came on suddenly) and if I didn't show up I could have been fired. Fortunately for me, I now work for a company with PTO,  but sadly there are many people in my situation. \n\nPS - I didn't have anything contagious, but an EMT customer took one look at me, asked me if I'd checked my temperature, and told me to go to the ER...which I did, after work."
b"That's on the employers."
b"This advice is so vague as to be almost useless.\n\n- Is he saying that you should stay home if you show **any** symptoms of fever/cough/flu at all, regardless of severity? \n- Has any arrangements been made to deal with the impact of removing a substantial portion of the working population if this policy is implemented? I'm thinking of unintended consequences- like the closure of schools in Japan leading to the reduction of medical staff who have to stay home to babysit their kids.\n- How is this supposed to work? Do you just phone your boss and tell him you're taking time off? I see **that** working out well.\n\nThe way these ad-hoc advice is being released by the current administration is... not confidence inspiring."
b"I've been waiting for something from my work offering extended sick time to cover it if we get it. The other day they just posted something that basically just said stay home if you're sick and had us redo our food safety quizzes. I have about a week of sick pay. After that, I can't really be out of work. So I guess we'll see what happens."
b'Thats funny as too they will not respect it and people will point out and get fired.'
b"How sick is sick enough? I've got a bit of sniffles and a very very slight cough. Do i quarantine?"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m driving to work now with a nasty cold/possible flu because we are desperately short on staff (nurse). Bring on the surgical masks and non-stop handwashing and keeping my fingers crossed charge or management sends me home. Can\xe2\x80\x99t stay home when patients are coming in 24/7'
b'let me rephrase this a bit: Employer, if you do not support this you are a fucking moron.'
b"Great advice except., if I miss more than 3 days I am required to have a Doctor's note.  \n\nSince you can't get tested no Doctor is going to write me a note saying I can't come to work for 2+ weeks to not spread the Virus if I get it.  (assuming my symptoms are fairly mild)\n\nNot to mention my job doesn't give sick days so I wouldn't get paid."
b"Unless the federal government gives employers money to pay people with, you won't see massive PTO increases.\n\nMost American businesses are small, and can't afford PTO under normal circumstances, let alone with reduced income.  Google US small business statistics sba for more info.\n\nThings aren't too bad yet, I'm already dealing with some Corona virus related problems with my small business.  If we get mandatory closures without some sort of financial assistance, a lot of Americans will be jobless because their jobs won't exist anymore."
b"is that the same one guy who told y'all US guys that masks won't work? \n\nlmao"
b'The CDC\xc2\xa0said that so far this season, 34 million people have gotten\xc2\xa0the flu,\xc2\xa0and about 20,000 have died....so yeah.'
b"My employer just gave all employees an additional five paid sick days for the year, to make sure we don't come in sick. If you have to be quarantined beyond that, you can use short-term disability to keep getting paid. I'm super lucky to work for an employee-owned business, though."
b'HAHAHHAHAHAHA!\n\nMy wife came down with a horrible respiratory infection here in the US (PNW). Her parents and I took her to the hospital stat.\n\nThe nurse fucked up her IV and she ended up dripping blood on the ground and in tears: she still has the purple stains from the blood leaked under her skin. Either way, at least she got her medicine. \n\nShe is a type-1 diabetic. That shit is fucking genetic, so if you have any comments about "Americans fat, you deserve diabetes" save \'em: you can shove them up your fucking ass and get fucked. \n\nOur state has recently enacted mandatory paid sick-leave, one of the very few in the whole nation to have this. Within the local context, that means shit however. Every time a law like this is passed, shitty businesses find a way to pass the tab on to their workers or straight up defy it. A seafood processor gave their employees (mostly immigrants) a letter saying "while the state has passed X law, our company policy is different".\n\nHer workplace policy is that you need to be gone MORE THAN 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS to be able to apply, because of course, you have to apply and it is up to them to come up with reasons why they can\'t give it to you. Those of you who are smart, noticed that this is basically 8 consecutive days instead. She gets sick on sunday, spends all week recovering, on sunday she is ok-ish, but her sick-leave policy does not apply since it wasn\'t 5 consecutive work days or more. She just lost over 1500 dollars in income, and her nice government insurance still left her with a 500 dollar co-pay (thank fucking god, that is cheap around here). \n\nShe is a professional who works for the state government btw. \n\nImagine the poor dude working at a warehouse or at the airport polishing floors? \n\nThose people are going to die and do so while in medical debt. Funerals around here start at about 7000 for a crap casket and a video/slideshow of your miserable life in bad resolution-pictures.\n\nSo yeah, that dude is disconnected from reality when asking people to stay at home.'
b'They can try but companies don\xe2\x80\x99t have an endless reserve of savings.  Some are living AR to AR and using lines of credit to finance working capital.     Little businesses are going to get crushed by this. While they should have enough money to cover any normal PTO and Vacation, beyond that, it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the bank accounts to run dry.  Some will do better than others but I suspect like most Americans, most companies are living paycheck to paycheck. I have do idea about the cash reserves of publicly traded companies, but SMBs will burn up pretty quick. \n\nTo put in perspective:  26m companies in the USA. Only around 20k are publicly traded. 95% are 3 employees and less than $500k/yr.   I tiny fraction of companies have gross revenues in excess of $1m/yr.  \n\nSMBs employ the bulk of the workforce.  \n\nThis is going to be very painful economically.   But if we don\xe2\x80\x99t pull together and slow this down, the health care system will be overwhelmed and there will be needless death.   \n\nThis is a national emergency.   We should start acting like it.  \n\nIf you are still reading this, you are the resistance.  Social distancing NOW.'

b'So when I\xe2\x80\x99ve exhausted my PTO what do I do? I took 2 days last week as I felt sick and ended up being fine but I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that again, I only have 60% of days remaining for 2020. I work in a small company FULL of baby boomers so working from home isn\xe2\x80\x99t even something they are aware exists.'
b'TELL THAT TO WALMART.'
b"Who goes to work sick? My boss would send me home immediately if I came to work sick - although it never occurred to me to go to work sick. If I have a cold I stay home for a week instead of infecting my colleagues.\n\nUsually it's like this: you're sick, you call the company and say you're sick, then you go to the doctor (usually your family doctor) and get a confirmation. This confirmation does not contain the exact diagnosis, because this is a private matter and does not concern the employer. Later you give this medical confirmation to the employer, usually by email. You come back to work when you are healthy, no matter how long it takes.  You will receive full pay (including bonuses) as long as you are sick, even if you are sick for months - but a doctor must confirm this. The company must pay the full wage for between 6 and 12 weeks, depending on how long you work already at this company, then half the wage for 4 weeks.  The state health insurance company then pays the rest, so you always get 100% of the salary you would get without illness.\n\nIn order to relax and to be less at risk of falling ill, holidays are very important. Statutory holiday (vacation days) entitlement is 5 weeks per year (people who have worked more than 26 years are entitled to 6 weeks), fully paid, of course.  On top of that there is an extra monthly salary, which is tax-privileged. So you get a more than two monthly salaries during vacation (for Christmas there is an additional monthly salary extra). On top of that, there are 13 public holidays for which the normal salary is also paid, unless they fall on a Sunday. If I get sick during my vacation days, this is no longer counted as vacation days, but as sick leave - which means that I can make up for this vacation days later.\n\nIf you are prevented from working, you are entitled to full pay for a maximum of one week, depending on the case, but you are obliged to avoid being prevented from working if possible. Typical cases of incapacitation would be:\n\nVisit to the doctor (only if the doctor is only open during your working hours or in case of acute pain), own wedding, death and funeral or wedding of a close relative, witness in court, no travel to the place of work due to natural disasters, moving house, birth of a child (for the father, mothers are not allowed to work for 8 weeks before the birth date anyway, but get this paid by the state health insurance).\n\nNone of this is a special performance of the company, but is required by law for the whole country - every company has to handle it this way. Trump and FOX call this socialism.\n\nAmericans, change your system, the current one exploits you."

b"When I started where I'm working now back in 2008, they had unlimited sick leave. I was like what? That is unheard of. Their mentality back then was that if people would really stay home when they were sick and that policy had been in place for a long time. Then a couple of years ago they ended it because a bunch of people abused the policy and stayed home sick for weeks at a time when they weren't sick. They still give us 12 days of sick days off which is still unbelievable but it's a use or lose policy and now a bunch of people suddenly get sick in December right before it resets."

b'When I was younger I was working at a sub shop, called in sounding like a demon (throat thing) and said I can\'t go in I\'m very sick, owner tells me I work or get fired.. So I go in deathly sick by this point new employee but I hadn\'t ever called in, clearly sick I decide to try and mostly work the back right? I get fired on the spot for being "useless" I proceed to go to the doctor, I hsd strep and a really bad sinus infection,  proceed to sleep 20 hours for two days straight.\n\nThank god I wasn\'t the first employee to complain about illness exposure, I was part of a huge court case that shut this person\'s business down but it took a solid 10 people to get anything to happen.'
b'U.K. worker - my employer regards it as a badge of honour if you come in when sick (they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay sick leave so most people come in) The sicker you are the bigger the badge of honour.'
b"The company I used to work for pulled that shit too.  During my interview I was told I had paid PTO and paid sick days.  It wasn't until after I got hired that they clarified sick days came out of my PTO.  I now work in a state that mandates that I get 5 days of paid sick days per year in addition to my PTO.  I had spinal fusion surgery last year and was supposed to take 6 weeks off per my surgeon, but I was back after 2 weeks because I ran out of sick leave and PTO."
b"Mine does that, but I get PTO and sick time separately. If I don't have sick time, I use PTO. I think it's mandated in my state, though."
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s such a bummer. Although I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of your PTO. My full time job which requires a masters degree and 2 years post-degree training doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it.'
b'I get a huge amount of PTO. Walked in the door and had 10 holidays + 3 weeks PTO plus the week between Christmas and New year off cuz no one does anything anyways.\n\nNone of that anemic two weeks and you might get three after five years. Nope everyone gets like 5 weeks worth of PTO ( though ten of it is paid holidays ).'
b'My company sent out an email to not come to work if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick and to stay home until you feel better for at least 24 hours. And to feel free to take PTO to cover the time. Needless to say, everyone I talked to has zero plans to stay home if they get sick,'
b"Wait. Is that not normal? That's all I've ever known."
b'I\'m an employer and we only give "personal days" that people can use as they choose. This is first I\'ve heard anything negative about it, and I\'d like to hear more. Our thinking is that they can take what would have been sick days as vacation days and vice versa, and it keeps people from lying to us about why they\'re out.'
b'Can relate. I used to work for a company that you had to PLAN sick days. Another company I worked for wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let employees take sick days unless 3 days of PTO had been taken previously.'
b"This is basically (with the way some symptoms are mild) a guaranteed way to spread the disease.\n\nPeople are living on a financial razor's edge, and it is impossible to not expect people to go into work sick, when the alternative is putting yourself, your housing, in financial jeopardy."
b'Hey u sound like u work for kroger'
b'Same here. God forbid you get sick and already have a planned, paid-for vacation on the books - if you have to use those sick days, you can forget about your trip. I hate it.'
b'Mine pulls the same shit too\xf0\x9f\x98\xa0'
b'my work released a statement to all of its employees late last week letting us know that they just implemented a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstance sick leave policy\xe2\x80\x9d. basically we all had 40 hours added to a separate PTO bank because of the coronavirus. they are encouraging us to stay home if we\xe2\x80\x99re sick and said if anyone comes into work exhibiting symptoms, they will be sent home. \n\nI just wanted to throw this out there to let people know that some companies are trying.'
b'exactly and especially if alot of people start getting sick\n\nEdit: which they already have'
b'And most people can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to just not go to work for 2 weeks, especially when there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that 2 weeks will be enough.  People have died after being cleared of the virus due to immune system complications.'
b"Hopefully it doesn't just ravage through America because of their healthcare system"
b"Actually we've already had reports of companies paying employees who don't have work to do since they went to remote work to avoid the virus. Voluntary paid sick leave is also something some employers did already."
b"My state of New York, I'm pretty sure, declared this should all be covered? But I am an idiot and you're not talking about coverage you're talking about paid leave."
b'Uk won\xe2\x80\x99t help self employed people.\nWe have a ssp payment of \xc2\xa394.24 a week.\nYou still have to find mortgage/council tax and everything else.\nRoughly about 350 a week.\nSooooooo you are - \xc2\xa3260 before you start \xf0\x9f\xa4\xac'
b'US needs a whole revamp on health care and how employers deal with their employees'
b'the government also needs to institute work from home for those able. Employers are not going to take these steps and we are just asking for this shit to spread. Yeah, I am most likely not going to die from this virus, does not mean I am okay with getting it, or risk spreading it to my aging parents and elderly grandparents.'
b'> Other countries do it.\n\nNote that in a lot of countries, sick leave are paid by the healthcare system not by the employer. Sounds stupid, but having one employee sick has not the same impact if you are a 2 person business or a 500 employee corporation'
b"We give okay time off, but I totally agree. The financial standing is the company you work for, or their willingness to grant time off shouldn't change how much time off you get. I would rather have a payroll tax fund sick and maternity leave"
b"My company has tons of paid sick leave. More than I'll ever use unless I have a really serious illness.\n\nYet we have many employees that come to work coughing regularly, year round. I think they largely are still in the old mindset that working through illness is noble."
b"Unfortunately, for some people, even people at a desk, they have a job where they can't actually take anything home with them if they're sick, due to security risks, so we get screwed if we get sick and have to stay home."
b'Unionize and strike. In mass.'
b'Shithole country is the preferred terminology'
b"Going to the doctor and sick leave is for pansies. We're not some Euroweenies that need handouts like basic quality of life guarantees"
b'Wealthiest country in the world.'
b"I know, right?  It amazes me how many people here talk America is the greatest country on the planet, right before or after talking about their personal struggles and the struggles of those they love that clearly show it isn't."
b'Oh dont worry we can all just take a small 1 million dollar loan from our father and become billionaires and future president. /s'
b'Congratulations: your expertly skilled comment just squarely utilized every letter of the alphabet! Wow!'
b'Lol'
b'"Democrats introduce.." RIP that bill.'
b'Sadly they never say what bill it is.\n\nIs it this one?\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1185/all-info\n\nIt seems not right though. That makes basically a flu sick leave office and administration overhead. Not the simple solution the hill is talking about.'
b'The easy way to ensure this passes is to make the tax breaks these companies get every year dependent upon them offering the 2 weeks paid.  It\xe2\x80\x99s at least a way to get the lobbyists out of the way.'
b'The scary word might fix the problem >!democratic socialism !<'
b"What is the most admirable creature on God's green Earth? Why, it's the bee! Have you ever seen a bee on vacation? Have you ever seen a bee take a sick day? Well, my friends, the answer is no! So I say, be\xe2\x80\xa6 the bee! Be the bee!"
b'TBF, the bill is actually "let employees accrue 7 days paid sick time" AND make an additional 14 days available immediately during health emergencies.\n\nSo assuming you had already accrued 7 days, you would have those to use for those other things. (But I still totally agree even with 7 extra it\'s not enough)'
b'Or actually gets the virus or gets quarantined again.'
b"Well hopefully that's what happens.\n\nIf people start getting sick and can't get hospital treatment without paying for it or get clean water or food then the 327 million people living in the USA, many of whom are armed with serious guns won't care about a bailout or the stock market or money or banks."
b"Here in Germany, you're required to have a doctor's note to utilize a paid sick day. (Which is also a lot easier because doctor's visits of this nature are completely covered by insurance.)"
b"Why are these bullshit excuses always used for the US can't do something but they never stopped any of the countries that have these things and have had them for decades?"
b'There are tons of ways to curb the potential abuse of this. Regardless, all else equal, I think possible abuse of power should be given to the workers rather than the employers. Employers have been abusing the system for decades through poor pay, poor benefits, etc.'
b"It's not supposed to be a comparison.  It's a slippery slope joke..."
b"Employers with low wage workers don't give a shit if they die, they can be replaced in 5 minutes."
b">He's saying that paid sick leave saves the employer money in the long run\n\nAnd that right there is the problem, companies do not care about the long run, they care about next quarter."
b'And you are interacting with customers, or at least surfaces customers touch. That is why COVID-19 will spread very fast in USA.'
b'> If I have 4 call offs in 6 months im fired.\n\nthats actually illegal. So the official reason for firing will be different.'
b"It's nothing special. I am from another European country, and here you always get 100% of the salary (and bonus) as long as you are sick - no matter how long it takes. And that is up to you and your doctor, not the company. That is the law, all companies have to act according to it. This is a matter of course for most western, rich countries (well, except the USA)."
b'Europeans: What are hospital/medical/doctor bills? Never seen one.\n\nAmericans, you need to change your system.'
b"It also makes your illness last longer if you don't actually rest! Take a sick day and *sleep*. I have coworkers who come to work sick, coughing everywhere, and then they're like that for three weeks. If they'd just stayed home and rested and let their body actually recover, it probably would have lasted a fraction of that long."
b'Wish I could upvote you more. Yeah I get pto, but I\xe2\x80\x99m part time with chronic health issues so it takes forever to get, and is gone instantly. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really scary right now, if they close schools? Fucked. If they close work? Fucked. \n\nNo one wants to go to work sick or spread it or anything, we just have such an absolute shit country that only cares about corporations and the wealthy. It puts you in an awful place. Potentially spread something you might have and risk other people? Or stay home and 100% lose everything you have because you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to miss work.'
b'My Fiancee and I found out recently it is cheaper for us to be on separate healthcare plans, which sucks, especially with what mine covers it would be more helpful to her. While I was looking at the cost of that I saw what my premiums would be for family coverage, that alone was like "yep, that is financial no to children".'
b'I totally understand this. I am so lucky to have sick pay. I took some unpaid time after my child was born and it took us months to catch up on our finances.'
b'Get your group together and go to HR. Tell HR that they either send the sick lady home **now** or all of you are calling out sick **now**.'
b'The family that works together shares illnesses together! T-thats how the saying goes, right?'
b"Wage theft is higher than *all* property in USA. We need local state and federal government to create good laws like paud sck leave for all companies with more than somany works - and the actually *enforce* those laws. \n\nAlso see article s in how it's enforcement has continuously dropped for high income will ramping up on poor and low income .."
b'I need a cigarette'
b"ok well thats not your fault, they should hire more people. If they are struggling then higher ups deal with the problem not the ''team'' or you. This is why i got out of those warehouse jobs. Slimey fucking business but stable money."
b'Yep, work in a factory and when someone calls in sick manager somehow expects me to be able to do same amount of work without that person somehow lol...then again I called in sick more than my coworkers haha'
b'Only with a cherry on top \xf0\x9f\x8d\x92'
b"I am sure that because they used this majic word, employeer will make sure to jump at the chances to do as asked. The truth is, we are profit 1st and everything else is second so no matter how it's asked, it will be ignored unless it benefits the corporation"
b'How disgusting is that?! They want sick people serving other people food and getting the customers sick too just so they can turn a profit.'
b'Which one is it so I know not to eat there and give them my business?'
b'Well not if 20% of the country is dying'
b">Oh, not t\n\nyes the freedom to walk into management's office with covid-19 and start coughing.. 'MERICA  FUCK YEAH!"
b'Honestly, I am surprised that freedom is much better back home in Europe than here. Well, besides the freedom of having a gun, yes, that one is much stronger here.\n\nBut it kind of clicks when you realize its perfectly legal to open carry a gun here, but you can get in trouble for open carrying a can of beer on the street.'
b'Risky for whom? GDP per capita in the European welfare states is comparable to that of the USA. So, who would lose if the US were to better protect the broad masses of ordinary workers?'
b'Long story short, our HR is not very good at being HR'
b"My kids school sent out an email that everyone needs to download an app, and get familiar with it in case they cancel in-person classes and move to online only. \n\nAnd for those who don't have internet access, they somehow have plans to enlist the help of one of our public broadcast TV stations, and will be giving lessons and homework on there, with a hotline set up for students/families with questions on schoolwork.  \n\nI'm quite impressed. I hope more schools/districts are doing this."
b'Can you imagine how fast this will spread in an Elementary school?!? Just stomach bugs travel fast.. This would be horrible.'
b'Like what?'
b'U.K. is the European version of the USA. All for the 1% at the top and - because Europe - for the 10% at the bottom. Who pays on top is the middle class, who now turn crazy people into premiers.'
b'Damn I\'ve worked at my company 12 years and get 4 weeks and 5 "sick days" that are included in those 4 weeks. Haha'
b'Same here. Job advertised 21 PTO, sick days and holidays. I was like "Oh wow, 21 vacation days, and sick days, and holidays? That\'s amazing." Even mentioned it to the recruiter and she didn\'t say anything.\n\nGot into the job, realized ALL of it is pushed into one pile. I\'m forced to take time off for like Christmas or Thanksgiving, even if I don\'t want to and it all comes out of my pool. It\'s all accrued and on the same schedule.\n\n21 days is "generous" for most Americans, but I felt lied to and it really soured my first couple of weeks at this job that really never got much better.'
b'yeah americans should get at minimum 14 days a year off regardless. Times are rough right now and most of us are working alot of hours to make ends meet'
b'Man the biggest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt from this is how crap sick pay is in the USA. Here in the UK my last 2 jobs I\xe2\x80\x99ve had 6 months full pay, 6 months half for sick leave, plus 30 days holiday + bank holidays PTO. \n\nAre you guys alright? I think you need a Bernie revolution hard over there or something haha'
b'My company has both, but anytime you are sick, the first 16 hrs comes out of PTO.... so many people wont call in.'
b'Your employer/insurance plan does not offer short/long term disability time?'
b'What state are you in now... ?'
b'Sounds like this would have beena situation where Short term disability insurance might have been helpful. Does your company offer that as a benefit?'
b"Companies that do this, tend to add both sick and PTO days to a total number of days allowed. The employee's do not lose anything, but simpler reporting, less legal issues or complications. No more bullshit around is it sick? is it not? do yo need a doc note?  etc.\n\neg: You get 19 days off per year, use it as you wish. The math works out the same."
b'If I get sick on my holiday, that day does not count as a holiday day.\n\nAll of Sweden is like that.\n\nThe US is just totally fucked up.'
b'Yeah ours just takes it out of our pto pool'
b"It's not huge. It's lower than mandatory PTO in most countries."
b'Does PTO in your case lump in sick days as well?\n\n\nAnd I also assume that weekends are not counted as PTO?'
b"I'm guessing you work an office job.\n\nLets see what food service does (not) do and watch how dangerous that will be."
b"Fingers crossed my company goes this route. Currently they use are PTO if we call in. Its 14 days of quarantine if you get the coronavirus,  I work 5 days a week, I don't want to waste 10 days of my PTO."
b"My work is a desk job FOR a major US city with some of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases. I had a terrible cold last week and asked my employer if I could work from home, so I didn't alarm my colleagues with my cough. They said no and I had to come into work all week. Oh, and I'm 32 weeks pregnant."
b'A lot of people are hospitalized for weeks though'
b"Honestly, they should have said if anyone try's coming into work  exhibiting symptoms, they'll be fired."
b'Can you source that please? Happy cake day btw.'
b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one good thing about this eventual pandemic (and of course, it will be a singular island of a good thing amidst a vast sea of awful), it\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility it will wake the rest of America up to the notion that our workplace standards (compensated sick leave being rare, health insurance tied to employment, etc) are uniquely terrible and need reform.'
b'im screwed if i get sick'
b'Man every time I get sick all I can hear is my one manager going "well if your realllly sick you can stay home".'
b'I work through illness. From home. Where I can\xe2\x80\x99t spread my disease.\n\nMost colds don\xe2\x80\x99t knock you out from being able to do work. That still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should go spread it around.'
b"Because you're not a team player or serious about the job and someone will get promoted over you. Oh you shouldn't take much FMLA off either cuz else you look bad. Said by my own dad.\n\nSeriously fuck the boomers and Puritans who arrived here and started pressing witches in a few decades."
b'I would have to say it\'s a bit of both.  In my line of work, you are given paid time off, but are highly discouraged from using it ("take your vacation when you are in your lay off period." -manager), which of course leads to co-workers ragging on even taking a single day for sick or pleasure.  It\'s some machismo bullshit.'
b'Great point bc coming/going to work sick is a social mind set  bc folks dn want to risk the social opprobrium   they might get by staying at home!'
b"We have no limit on paid sick days and a very relaxed work from home policy, we still come in sick. There's definitely still a stigma or a mindset that unless you're bedridden you should be at work that's clearly very pervasive in our culture."
b"I know my dad is in this group. Some will go to work sick because if they use their PTO they will fall behind on certain projects, miss deadlines, etc that may cause them more stress anyway, so they'd rather just work through it. He only uses his PTO during times work is slow and he can go on a vacation or something."
b'my husband is a union electrician. he has zero PTO. if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. if his company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a project for him, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. his company was already slow and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a place to go for this week. \n\nwe live in a major US city, and i predict in the next few weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on some kind of shut down. and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way in hell his company or the union is giving any PTO. i have no idea what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.'
b'Ironically, the place I work at is a union shop.  Most of these union people complain about being overworked but still support politicians that want to destroy unions and roll back protections for laborers.'
b"I guess I'm that Euroweenie that left America for those handouts. Oh well!"
b"Exactly! If you are with an illness, and you can't afford healthcare, it simply means you didn't work hard enough and you deserve to die, those lazy drains of society."
b'For the rich.'
b"I don't think there are any redditors claiming the US is the greatest country on the planet"
b'I just double checked this just because I was curious and, wow, this really does have the whole alphabet! Kinda neat!'

b'Now outlaw insecticides.'
b'That old guy on the princess cruise ship is still carrying the virus after 21 days! Chinese had to extend quarantine to 28 days after discovering some people still registering as infected post symptom stage. All it takes is a few people who are infected after a massive quarantine to cause a resurgence all over again. If we do create a vaccine in 18 months, it will be a world record in fastest vaccine ever created by humanity. After its creation, they will not have 7 billion vaccines instantly on hand either.

b"trying to get a doctor's note here in the us right now,  might be kind of tough.   i personally don't go to the doctor everytime i feel under the weather,  and i would suspect a ton of other people are in the same boat.   also if im sick,  (...not deatlhy sick), the last thing i want to do i drag my butt out if bed and sit in a doctor's office."
b"That's still unreasonable if you have to do that for even just 1 or 2 days. If I have a migraine, I can't even safely take myself to a doctor. I may not even be able to speak or compose an intelligible email for a while. Moreover, the doctor can't do anything but tell me to get the fuck back home and rest.\n\nForcing a doctor's visit and note just infantilizes the working adult population, waste's the doctor's time, and at best prevents the sick person from resting and puts them in contact with people sick with other things."
b"We get a bill well over a hundred dollars for a basic doctor visit here in the states. That's with insurance. This makes it near impossible for low income people to get in to a clinic to get a doctors note. Now, you lose out on wages AND have to pay to see a doctor."
b"Depends on the employer though. With most you can take 3 sick days in a row before you need a doctor's note."
b"A doctor's note would cost me $200 :("

b"Like paid sick leave provided by the government so your employer doesn't have to."
b'Washington State recently passed a law (I think two years ago) where everyone pays \xe2\x80\x9cillness premiums,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really a new form of tax (it\xe2\x80\x99s important they call it something else because Washington State does not have any income tax).\n\nThe idea is we all pay into a fund, and then when people need to take sick leave they can, and the government pays for their sick time, up to some number of week.\n\nBut this is for sick *leaves* not sick *days*. Leaves are extended periods of time, more than three days, like the two weeks you\xe2\x80\x99d need with COVID-19.\n\nThey also have a new requirement that employees be allowed to accrue sick time that companies will pay for, to deal with sick days.\n\nBoth programs also enable you to take care of someone that is sick in your family.\n\nThese kinds of programs are the kinds we need. Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for this thread, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details because my employer offers unlimited paid sick time (lucky me) so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to investigate the law as much. I know they take a portion of my earnings to pay the fund, and I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that because I\xe2\x80\x99d rather pay for others to receive benefits in ways that make sense.\n\nUnfortunately now the program is flooded with applicants and is falling behind. This was true even before COVID-19, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better unless it\xe2\x80\x99s getting more resources.'
b">y lots of people while they are shut down, when their customers are cancelling orders or avoiding new purchases.  When they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cash to pay the mortgage, utilities, invoices for inventory,  they also can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the wages.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of what they want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they can do.  We should be prepared to see emergency financing facilities like in previous crises and it will be a shit show of people screaming about bailouts and who gets them.\n\n we tax all of them uniformly and progressively so it's equitable (not equal) across the board and prevents one business from cutting it to gain an advantage over their competition."
b'Always get the policies fully explained in writing before you consider the offer.'
b'We get 10 PTOs, 10 calendar holidays and 3 sick leave. If we work a Saturday or a Calendar holiday due to a production release we get an extra PTO.\n\nI used to work in Europe. We had 15 Calendar holidays, 32 PTOs, unlimited sick time with doctors note. if I worked any of the Calendar holidays I got additional PTO. I was able to take a Month of vacation back home every year as well as many short 2-3 day breaks when work wasnt super busy to go visit neigboring countries.'
b'21 days including holidays and sick days is awful.  The US has about 10 holidays they celebrate so you are actually only getting about 2 weeks of combined sick time and vacation time that isn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to a holiday.'
b'This is not typical. PTO polices EXCLUDE company holidays.'
b'The problem is abuse.\n\nMost places implement a use it or lose it. Hardly ever does a company pay you out for any time you did not take at the end of the Fiscal year'
b"....but what about the CEO's million dollar bonuses that they so desperately need?!!!!!   (Sarcasm)"
b'Yes. Yes we do.'
b"They do (have to pay extra for it), but it would only paid about 1/2 of my salary and wouldn't pay me until I was out for a month.  As the primary caregiver with 4 kids I couldn't afford to do that."
b'Same in Poland, 26 days PTO per annum and unlimited paid sick leave at 80% base salary.'
b'That is basically the case in almost all - at least rich - countries in the whole world.'
b'US. One time I had scheduled a vacation, got food poisoning while there and was basically sitting in the bathroom for 2.5 days out of 4 when I got back. My boss said "that sucks, but at least you\'re back here!" I didn\'t have a vacation and they thought it was great that I was back at my desk. Such a stupid mentality.'
b'Uh I work in the US for one of the companies that regularly makes the "worst employer" lists and we have the same policy.  If I get sick on vacation, I get to use a sick day instead of vacation day.'

b"I work in food service, and it's my job to handle this crisis. I'm honestly at a loss for what to do - if somebody reports being sick, I will probably give them PTO. But if I announce a Coronavirus 'PTO bank', you better bet everybody is going to use it almost immediately, sick or not."

b'I work in a local butcher shop for a large loblaws chain and theyll hire people part time, give them full time hours then they dont get sick days or PTO. Just a lump sum vacation pay in summer. Only the full timers get PTO and sick days. Gotta squeeze every dollar into profits!'
b'Almost twenty years ago I used to work in retail and the store managers would give us some serious grief if we tried to call in sick. Sometimes they would ask for a doctors note...\n\nI was so irritated and wanted to say \xe2\x80\x9clook I\xe2\x80\x99m a part time worker who works 40+ hours a week. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the crappy health plan and I don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick leave so if I call in sick I don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid which hurts me financially\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nI am not going to spend money I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the doctors office if I feel like crap for a day or two and just self quarantine myself in my bedroom.\n\nOthers would drag their sick butts into work hacking on their hands, putting their hands on product as they pack your bags.'
b"I am a restaurant general manager. Last week I thought I might be coming down with strep, and was facing absolutely no option to stay away from my store. A few weeks ago, I was suffering some sort of weird stomach bug that was more pain than action, but I still had to show up and do my job 6 days that week.\n\nModern life relies heavily on fast food, and yet we overlook serious protections necessary to ensure that food service is provided safely. People want their food as cheap as possible, so I don't even really blame my FOO (boss) for being unable to pay me sick leave (we are seeing increases in sales volume yet have to cut labor hours to afford operations costs, because franchise restaurants are very low profit outfits (with rising food costs, mandatory low price menu deals, skyrocketing rent and insurance rates, etc.)."

b'I work primarily for a large Silicon Valley employer but I am actually a contractor and our company also has other clients.\n\nWell my client just asked us to work from home . So as I am a manager my company thinks with no employees in office, I have nothing to do so can I go do a 2 week assessment at another client. \n\nI am sure the other client will appreciate when I tell them I am breaking self quarantine to come cough on them.'
b'Wish all of my coworkers thought that way.'
b'Even though my coworkers and I could 100% do our jobs from home, our company would still have us trek through public transit in an area with confirmed cases and have butts in seats. Apparently, as long as we wash our hands- all good.'

b"That's literally the fucking point of why we need it"
b'Sounds fantastic'
b"Liberal welfare states are a bit different from social democracy (which is what most people mean by democratic socialism). The main difference is that social democracy doesn't bother with means testing every program, it makes them universal to reduce complexity and maximize access.\n\nFor example, currently student financial aid is gatekept by family income. However, if you get denied a grant due to your parents high income, they have no obligation to pay for your tuition and you may be stuck with high interest loans despite having a need for the aid if they refuse to help.\n\nHealthcare is also greatly simplified by giving universal access. This is done across the developed world and even in some less developed parts.\n\nFor an example in the US, just look at K-12 education. No one thinks we should means test parents and charge a sliding scale of tuition for your kid to go to school. Education is considered a basic, universal right and is taxpayer funded in its entirety for simplicity and maximum equity."
b'The idea is that America is so entrenched in capitalism that without flat out destroying every federal branch, every upper level executive in every american company, including banks, capitalism won\'t be deconstructed. And even then you have a lot of the working class kind of brainwashed into defending the shit anyways.\n\nSo "democratic socialism" or whatever it\'s called is the next best thing.\n\nBut hey, maybe covid19 will do exactly that.'
b"No that's social democracy. Not the same thing"

b'Yeah and it works just fine in a lot of places.'
b"No that's Nordic model capitalism."
b"Yeah. Honestly I think anything we do is just a platitude that will make people feel better about things.

b"In Australia they brought in medical certificates at the pharmacy. You go in with symptoms and they assess you. eg a bad cold you don't function well so why turn up and infect others.  \nDoctor is free because of nationalised medicine.\n\nPharmacy medical certificate costs money so if not really sick then lose money for sickpay."
b"What he or she said about Germany isn't entirely true. It's when you miss 3 consecutive days of work or more that you definitely need a doctor's note."
b"In the UK, I can self-certify as sick for 7 days. If I want paid sick leave after that, I need a doctor's note."
b'It isn\'t required until day 3 off of work. \n\nThis mind set is the thing I do not miss from the US. There are a ton of GPs around me. It takes less than 5 minutes for me to get to a doctors office on foot. The next closest is in the center of my town, a 5 minute tram ride away. \n\nIt also isn\'t "[a] waste of time" or "infantaliz[ing] the adult population." It allows doctors here to prevent potentially serious illnesses that could crop up from not treating something.\n\nIn the US on the other hand, you don\'t have the "luxury" of just walking to your local GP, having them immediately accept your insurance and you actually get to talk to someone. In the states when I was still living there, you had to find a GP that was in-network, you\'d have to make an appointment, then figure out how to get to that appointment because it sure as fuck wasn\'t within walking distance, then wait for 2+ hours to talk to a doctor, and then you get to pay for the pleasure. \n\nI get it, the mindset is different, but just because the system in the US doesn\'t work, doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t in other countries.'
b"Let me be clear that I don't think any country in the world has a perfect system! My comment was only meant to point out that there are ways that employers wouldn't have to worry about abuse of the system. With an issue like chronic migraines, that is perhaps something which must be worked out with employers on a case by case basis."
b'Employment lawyer here (but not yours and this is not legal advice).\n\nJust last week, someone was asking me what they could do when a woman called out sick for a couple of days when her request for PTO was denied. Unfortunately, the local paid sick leave law said that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t require a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note because it was only two days. The woman had a history of doing stuff like this, too \xe2\x80\x94 in multiple years she\xe2\x80\x99d use literally all of her sick time for the year on Mondays and Fridays, and she\xe2\x80\x99d come in with contagious illnesses other times. So even if asking for a note for a 1-2 day absence is usually overkill, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prohibited. There has to be a way to prevent abuse. Requiring documentation from a medical professional is much better than letting managers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t medical professionals make judgment calls, and you invite discrimination lawsuits when you don\xe2\x80\x99t apply requirements like that across the board; requiring a note every time makes sense. And as telemedicine becomes more common, the downsides of requiring a note will get smaller.\n\nIn any case, an employee with a migraine (or another disability with intermittent flare-ups) could ask to be reasonably accommodated by being exempted from a general requirement to provide a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note to use sick leave.'

b'Same! Stay safe!'
b"Sure. But if we don't take steps to help it could be higher!"
b"They also stick everything in their mouth, and they don't wash their hands.. Also they cough right in your face!"
b'touch. Cha. My coworkers kid has a habit of licking elevator buttons.'
b'This is really going to test the actuarial work that was done to establish the sick leave fund.  Which sounds like it was maybe failing already.  \n\nCompanies who self insure their health care insurance plans especially have incentives to offer generous sick leave because a sick employee at work generates more claims (in addition to lost productivity) when they infect others.\n\nI do wonder if the state laid off some of the big event risk (pandemic) to third parties, like reinsurance or something.'
b"Yup. I learned that mistake the hard way, which sucks because one of the reasons why I took this job was because I thought it would be more PTO days which would have allowed my wife and I to travel a little bit. Won't make that mistake again."
b"They know enough people will not confront them, and just assume they're not being hazy, that they basically don't worry about it.\n\nThe one person who acts up and calls up a manager and asks them to clarify the policy and doesn't take the job is worth the fifty people who  are just ecstatic to have a job and don't realize it until they get sick for the first time and can't come to work."
b"Yeah. I've been lucky to have a manager who sometimes allows work from home when we aren't feeling well but it's completely dependent on her mood and whether or not she likes you that week. I've used it a few times to work remote but other times I just end up coming to work and disinfecting everything I touch and staying away from people because I don't have the days to spare."
b"That's what I thought too. It's how it was at my previous job in the same field at a competitor, so I thought I was getting an improvement on vacation since they were poaching people."
b'Gotcha.  Sorry to hear that.  Our country sucks in this area that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.'
b"Jesus Christ y'all live in a fucking Utopia by comparison. It's remarkable."
b'same in the UK (for now at least)'
b'So why not the self described no.1 country in the world?'
b'Exactly. But they have company cars and shit. Ridiculous.'
b'Yeah I get 15 days(after a year of service) + 9 holidays. I have to be on call with check in meetings on Black Friday, thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve, so they really aren\xe2\x80\x99t holidays. They are enacting a 7 holiday and 2 flex days for people like me, but the 2 flex days only work for other \xe2\x80\x9cfederally recognized holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d So basically I don\xe2\x80\x99t get as many holidays as everyone else since These reset in February and I can\xe2\x80\x99t take them until I\xe2\x80\x99m officially in the on call rotation for holiday which I will be as I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one on my team with this perk... \nIt takes another 5 years of service to get to 20 days pto. \nYou better believe I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to work from home the days that I\xe2\x80\x99m sick. I may not be as productive but I\xe2\x80\x99m not wasting my pto on this.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the major problem: dishonest workers using sick time frivolously. My job has PTO and a very generous occurrence policy. However, these were put into place by the Union. The company still treats us poorly, which means most employees have a lack of respect for the company. If the company treated us better, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99d have fewer unnecessary call outs'
b'One worker with Corona in a restaurant is all its going to take to put you out of business.... the law suit will be enormous'

b"Honestly, wouldn't you rather risk someone taking a couple of slacker days and paying them a grand, rather than someone getting provably sick from your service and suing for maybe 100+ times that?"
b'Yep so better to not give it'
b"Can't you ask for a doctor's note as a proof?"
b"This is true across many sectors. 4-6wks vacation, 3 sick days, and 3-5 PTO. Within 6 months a majority have used all but a couple days. Then they're angry when they get the flu and we cannot allow them to work. I've lost around a years worth of vacation at this point but my work is completed and I use my days appropriately."

b"It's more like the USA is a dystopia compared to most of the industrialized world. I get unlimited sick leave and 25 days of PTO (30 next year due to company policy), and public holidays don't count towards that so that's another 10+ days of PTO."

b'From the DC area. No, we are not the largest metropolitan area in the USA, but at slightly over 6 million people, we are a large population vector. As a tourist hotspot, we have far more international travelers than nearly any other American city. This could get bad.'

Iran is also a place where religious gatherings are frequent. Italy is one of the most religious countries in Europe, where the average person still goes to mass every week. It's becoming clear that being in close proximity to a sick person for a prolonged amount of time is the biggest cause of spread, much more than contact with infected surfaces."

(WKBN) \xe2\x80\x93 A priest in the Washington, D.C. area has tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to CBS affiliate WUSA, Rev. Timothy Cole attended three services last Sunday at Christ Church Georgetown, which were attended by 550 people. Rev. Cole identified himself in a statement to his congregation.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is recommending anyone who visited the church between February 24 through March 3 to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nChrist Church Georgetown has suspended all services, meetings and other activities until further notice.\n\nA health statement from Mayor Bowser said DC Health was notified of the confirmed COVID-19 case on March 7.'
b"Almost all diocese across the country have temporarily suspended the sign of the peace, receiving under the species of wine, receiving on the tongue, and the use of holy water fountains for the public - other than being around people (no different than school), there's nothing unsanitary going on at masses and almost all Catholic Churches are taking significant precautions - note that the article refers to an Episcopalian church."

b'The professor failed the exam when it mattered the most.'
b'Not sure how viable this is in the EU, but I suspect in the states a class action against would not be out of the question.'
b'We are NOW preparing to do everything online, it took only a + professor and a bunch of angry students'
b'I think the biggest issue is there are two types of people right now. Those who have 100% faith in what their governments and health departments are telling them and those who realize this isnt even remotely a normal virus based on what they saw in china over the last few months.  \n\nThis professor was probably 100% following what he was being told through official channels and kept business as usual in order to prove a point. However, what he was told was wrong and has know brought possible harm to a lot of people.\n\nMy sister works in a hospital outside of chicago and when I asked her what they are doing about covid she basically laughed at me and said it was all scare tactics. She literally said she wont even think about it until she gets quarantined at her hospital.'
b'All the people I know in the medical community are doing the least amount of freaking out.'
b"You know what. Your profs don't give a single f about those sites."
b'No, definitely not! \nHe then said he had this \xe2\x80\x9cannoying mild fever\xe2\x80\x9d and decided to get tested'

b'Oh sweet summer child'
b"My professor forced us to stay and take our exam while ~~hurricane~~ tornado* sirens were going off and the school had sent out an alert that classes were canceled and to take cover. Over 50 people died in our town that day. He did get fired, so that's a plus.  \n\nEDIT: was a tornado not a hurricane. [link to info](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=tuscaloosa+tornado)"
b"When I was a biologist student I had professors that were chemists or pharmacologists. Some of them didn't know that dolphins aren't fish."
b'Teaching his subject the hard way'
b"He's a professor of infectious diseases, not a professor of quarantine."
b"Well just because he's an expert at whatever it is he teaches, it doesn't automatically make him more knowledgeable when it comes to reacting to the Coronavirus\n\n/s"
b'It\'s worth repeating that this isn\'t just "a" professor, it\'s an infectious diseases prof.'
b"My university here in the UK (Imperial) is still planning for exams to still be occuring in May and June, still planning for lectures and clinical placements to be continuing as usual while making no preparations for the inevitable increase in cases. \n\nIt's just shocking how supposed educated people and highly valued institutions teaching medical subjects who should know better are not doing the right thing to help combat this virus."
b'And universities need to shut down BEFORE a student or faculty test positive.  By that time they have been spreading for 2 weeks.'
b"Well you're in Naples, it should be expected. Just wait for all the southeners that came back to infect your families.\n\nIt's unlucky.\n\nMost of our professors on the contrary started with online lectures as soon as the first case arrived in the island. And we're even far away from Cagliari."
b"Hasn't it been canceled for the entire country since last Monday?"
b"Well, that's comforting <sarcasm>, and also terrifying."
b'Students care about them'
b'I did. I cared a lot when I went to uni - all 4 years, and it helped me stay away from some godawful professors, as it did with many other students. So despite the fact professors don\'t care, we, as students, do give multiple fucks about "those sites".'
b'I wish I could get tested but I live in America:('
b'Well, I was being sarcastic anyway, LOL!'
b'What professor was it? I slept through the early morning tornado, then watched the big one unfold on the news. Had nightmares for months.'
b'I remember hearing about that, that was a very nasty storm.'
b'Neither are whales or manatees, I believe.'
b"Well, then just assume you're smarter than them LOL."
b'Yeah, it is not like a professor of diseases would know to stay home, if he was sick, /S/'
b'Which makes it even more nuts in my view.'
b'I have to say that most of my professors decided to stop everything before the government made it official. Sadly there is always the idiot'
b"As a trades man that has worked my way deep into the cesspool of 'intellectuals'... I have found more wise individuals as laborers than educated people."
b'My university\'s dean refuses to suspend clinical rotations, saying that it\'s up to each hospital/clinic with positive cases to send students home and personal decision of the student in the facilities where there aren\'t any yet.  \nAlso said that we should still attend them because it\'s an "opportunity to learn and sacrifice". (!!!)  \nFuck this shit, I basically just stay there watching doctors working without doing anything nor helping at all while my chances of being infected rise by a ton. I\'m going back home in 3 weeks and no chance I\'ll infect my 70yo parents.'
b'No, at the time exams could be done if you respected some rules (for example keeping students 1m apart from each other), problem is that it\xe2\x80\x99s physically impossibile since we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about hundreds of students...\nNow however all the exams are stopped'
b"My University won't tell you who your professors are in the engineering school until about a week before classes as they don't want students switching sections based on reviews..."
b'I wish I still was in a lab. You could just send me a swab and I would test anyone for free.'
b"You know, I've tried remembering his name for years now and I can't. White guy with a beard and dark hair is all I can remember about him."
b'You have been subscribed to Whale Facts!\n\nDid you know Toothed\xc2\xa0whales\xc2\xa0are one of two\xc2\xa0whale\xc2\xa0groups, and only have one blowhole?'
b'The distinction between "whales" and "dolphins" is just an English language convention.\n\nDolphins are toothed whales, so are more closely related to sperm whales than either of them are to baleen whales (e.g. blue and humpback whale).'
b'People also. Definitely not fish.'
b'Manatees are mammals, easily observed in supermarkets on thier mobility scooters.'
b"No. I wasn't smarter than them. It's simply that people don't know everything. Even experts in their fields are proven wrong."
b'Well obviously.'
b"An idiot professor in Infectious Deceases, none the less.\n\nIt is both ironic and very sad.\n\nHope he didn't infect too many.\n\nBest of luck, op..."
b'Unforuntelly many people do not differnetiatel between wisdom/intelligence and knowledge. Education gives you knowledge. Wisdom you have to bring yourself.'
b"Ahh, because you are still having the exam season? At UniBo lectures were supposed to start on the 24th but then didn't and from last week we are online..."
b'How does one perform a coronavirus test? I know the kits are supposedly common reagents, that while maybe not "easy" to get ahold of, would be possible. Do you know what is in them, and the process for testing a sample?'
b'Why are they called that?'

b'Maybe he wanted to teach by example.'
b'He thought he should teach them a lesson about how infectious diseases spread, I reckon'
b'Yes, actually I still have an exam scheduled for the 19th but I guess will be canceled'
b"The reagents are \n\n1) Oligonucleotides for RT-PCR, taqman probe used if real-time PCR machine is  used\n\n2) PCR reagents: taq polymerase or better, dNTPs, buffer, Reverse transcriptase. Usually you can find a one Step Kit that has all these reagents in a 2X master mix.\n\n3) RNA extraction kit\n\n4) PCR machine or real time PCR machines\n\n5) Agarose gel electrophorisis if real time PCR is not used\n\nFor simple PCR you don't even need a machine. You can use 3 water baths. One @ ~55 C, the other @72 C and the third @ 95 C\n\nIf you are really interested there are youtube videos where you can learn to do it. The most expensive issue you will face are pippets. They are quite expensive."
b'Because they\xe2\x80\x99re holes the whale blows out of'
b'By the way, you can clearly see that whales/dolphins are not fish if you look at their skeletal structure.\n\nTheir pectoral fins are actually arms and hands, including the same finger bones that we have. They even have a vestigial pelvic bone. And the "blowhole" through which they breathe is homologous to our nose.\n\nThey evolved from even-toed ungulates (hoof animals, like cattle or giraffes).\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed\\_ungulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed_ungulate)'

b'To be honest thats pretty normal in these types of contracts.\n\nI worked for a temporary employment company for a few months and they send me to another company which mainly did logistics work.\n\nMost coworkers there told me that if youre sick more than once in like half a year, they cancel ur employement and you get send back. Many there needed those jobs and couldnt even afford the timeframe of switching.\n\nAt one point I had to do a task together with a coworker who then told me he wont be able to fully support me, since he went to the doc earlier that day and they used anesthatics on his elbow for some reason.\nHe still went to work, he said theyd fire him if he doesnt, theyd also fire him if they find out he came while being unable to actually work 100%.'

b'Very much a culture of not causing trouble for others and not sticking out very much.'
b'There is a culture here of not making a big deal out of medical complaints and not over-medicating.\n\nIf you go to a doctor with an cough/cold normally you\'ll be sent home with nothing, and told to get some rest. Got a headache? Drink some water.\n\nThere aren\'t even really "over the counter" cold/flu medications like Lemsip/Beecham\'s available here. If you\'re sick just get some rest and wait it out.\n\nTo be honest it\'s kind of nice.\n\nMaybe not the best attitude when you have an actual epidemic, but we\'ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe healthcare system here is very good and well-provisioned, and the population (inc. elderly) tend to be healthier/more active than in many countries.\n\n(Not Dutch, but live in the Netherlands)'
b'Colds are contagious too...'
b'I was/am sick with the cold like you! I had the exact same symptoms, but instead of cough, I had a runny nose. Experienced pain in my right lung too, especially when I took deep breaths. My sister and boyfriend showing some symptoms since a few days, it scares me.\n\nHave been isolating myself at home since wednesday, don\'t want to infect others or get infected myself. \n\n Same thing being told here by everyone, GP\'s, teachers, nurses, government, society in general : "stop being worried, you just have the flu /cold. Corona is nothing serious". \n\nMy school sent an email yesterday saying student from Noord Brabant (the province with most cases) should stay home when having symptoms, but! They should be aware of possible study delay which means they can\'t make exams and should decide themselves if that is worth staying home... They give students pressure to still attend school while being sick, even when possibly infected with the coronavirus, because I think no student wants to get study delay resulting in not getting enough credits to continue their study.... \n\nI have severe hypochondria and other anxiety related issues and just thinking of going out of the house, using public transport and being in enclosed spaces like classrooms filled with people is nearly enough to give me a panic attack.\n\nI hope for you and your family and friends to stay safe and for our countries to take actual action.'
b"Spain here. Our government encouraged massive marches for Women's Day and still hasn't cancelled the massive street festival in Valencia.\n\nWe're at over 1000 cases."
b'Sore throats are very rare with Coronavirus. Only about 5% of cases. Fever however is part of >99% of cases. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it, but those symptoms probably mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not a priority'

b"It's free real estate"
b'But Paris Climate agreement was "fuck the west, give 2 billion dollars to China".\n\nThey literally had no way to control that money even gets spend on fighting global change.

b'I laughed way too hard at this'
b'*Plague Inc. wants to know your location*'
b'I actually took that to mean \xe2\x80\x9cshe only started coughing and sneezing on the weekend, so there is less of a chance that she infected her schoolmates the week before\xe2\x80\x9d, which is logical but nevertheless not an excuse to discount possible contacts. \n\nAt the very very least, quarantines should be issued to her immediate classmates (i.e. the people she sits with most of the time - do your classrooms work this way? Or do kids rotate beyond a single class?) and teacher.'
b"> If you go to a doctor with an cough/cold normally you'll be sent home with nothing, and told to get some rest. Got a headache? Drink some water.\n\nI mean, it's the same way here(Iceland). If you actually go to the Doctor with the flu he'd just be annoyed you wasted his time like that because he has actually sick people to see. Still there seems to be an understanding here that this is not just the flu."
b'>Got a headache? Drink some water.\n\nThat sounds silly but the most common cause of a headache is dehydration and our bodies are pretty damn bad at telling us we are dehydrated and need a drink. especially if that dehydration was onset artificially (like by consuming alcohol or coffee)'
b'I\'ve been thinking the same, why don\'t we tell people to stay home when they\'ve got "just a cold"?\n\nNobody wants that shit, and it\'s so easy to stop.'
b"From what I'v read you should not have a runny nose if it's Corona."
b"We'll have a generation of doctors baptised in the Covid fire. For the doctors that are lucky enough to survive, that is. Health care worker fatalities in China have been huge. \n\n(This isn't something to look forward to, and not even a silver lining. It's just a statement that junior doctors are going to grow up fast. )"

b'>I actually took that to mean \xe2\x80\x9cshe only started coughing and sneezing on the weekend, so there is less of a chance that she infected her schoolmates the week before\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhich is logical say about an adult, but not a booger picking kid who licks every surface they come into contact with.'
b"What constitutes an actual sickness which won't annoy a doctor then?"

b'Theyre gonna drag their feet all the way. \n\nFirst it will be emphasizing \xe2\x80\x9cno symptoms\xe2\x80\x9d, they for sure have already tested him, eventually itll be \xe2\x80\x9clight symptoms Ted very healthy\xe2\x80\x9d and theyll inch their way towards the actual diagnosis and but staying as far away from \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d as possible. \n\n\nTheyll want him to be cured for the image it puts out there but theyll choose how severe they want to reveal it is based on what they need to hide. \n\nDid Trump get infected? They may need to misdirect attention from that considering Trump has for sure been tested frequently and they would know immediately as soon as it were detectable.'
b"He doesn't meet the CDC guidelines and does not want to publicly undermine them. At least he is self-quarantining. That's good. Look what happened to Iran's government once it started spreading to government officials ."
b'not enough tests available.'
b'False, testing is always useful.'
b"Conspiracy time, he's scared to catch it, staying home."
b"Much like masks. We dont have enough testing capacity. It's best to save them for when they will work the best"
b"It's probably true that it's not very helpful. Even when people have symptoms severe enough to go to the hospital PCR is only positive 70 percent of the time. Once the diseases progresses they are able to catch nucleotides and it turns positive."
b'not like we don\xe2\x80\x99t already have multiple countries showed lack of testing will make the disease spread like wildfire. in addition, lack of social safety net and affordable healthcare, you will have symptomatic people still going to work because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to.'
b"There isn't *enough* tests available is what is happening with the US, most likely. And it's not just a deficiency in resources (testing reagents, kits, equipment, etc.), it's likely also a lack of time and trained technicians available."

The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often.

And they want positive change, and genuine, long-term improvement in their lives but have watched the opposite occur. Constantly stymied and disappointed, their disappointment turns into frustration, then resentment, then hatred and rage. This drove people to fall for Obama's hope and change bullshit (me, for example) and for Trump's drain-the-swamp bullshit (my family, for example). We want a better society but every election, every mass movement, every revolution recedes leaving the same garbage in its wake. I suspect some of us hope to see this pandemic force society to change for the better, and if it doesn't then bring it all crashing down so the survivors can build something better.

b"It's either that or simply - why bother testing when they already know the results? I'm guessing at this point, if they rolled out massive testing nationwide this week... we'd quickly discover covid is already here by the 100s, if not 1000s of infected people. \n\nNo point confirming if they already know and it seems to be priority #1 to not cause any panic, because panic will be disastrous to the US economy"

b'No. A year is for the vaccines. The anti-viral from Gilead is already shown to be safe as it was tested for Ebola in mass trials. Its also shown effective in China on Coronavirus. This trial is just a way of corssing the is and dotting the ts. Rembesivir will be available in April for the general public at 1000 dollar a treatment.

I hate Trump, but right now I am rooting for him to be the strong leader that this country needs. He is, at least for the next 10 months, our president and it is his duty to guide us through this and protect American lives.

b"They are only saying that it's not travel-related and haven't revealed anything else. I bet she has had contact with a confirmed case, whether within TN or not."

Quest diagnostics will start testing as early as tomorrow, UW is taking a large load off of the DoH, and several other labs are getting sorted this week. Wider spread testing is coming very soon.

b'Definitely agree.'
b'I think he fully intends for the rest of us to read between the lines. I know I am.'
b"Supposedly he's repeating what his doctor says so that gives him deniability if the statement is flat wrong. Politics as usual."
b'Or at a closed-off beach.'
b'I think we all have a good idea how contagious and dangerous this virus can be. The administration is just lying to save face for the stock market.'
b'While they tell everyone else its fine to go to work. Yep nothing wrong with that.'
b"I live in Europe. It's the first time EVER I have heard about tests not working on people asymptomatic. The point of tests is that they work on everybody, including of course asymptomatic ones.\n\nWell, at least the german-made W.H.O. approved. The US ones, maybe they are faulty.\n\nWhy they aren't using the german ones, I don't know."
b"You are absolutely right-- if tests weren't so limited. He's covering for the shortage."
b'Much like with the masks. I havnt seen false information. The test will work best with a high viral load during a symptomatic infection. Thatd not a lie'
b'i have heard that the tests give false negativs every 3rd or 4th time.'
b"I don't like him but he's not covering up for anything... He's didn't make those claims, he's just repeating what the doctors told him."

b'Fuck the US economy. \n\nApparently unless billionaires start dropping dead from this, no proper action will be taken.'
b'If he has it, then all of Congress is at some risk, because he was in DC for a week and a half before self-quarantining. From there, basically anyone working for a Congressmember is at risk. Of course, the further out you go, the less likely it is.\n\nAnd he took a plane back to Texas, so passengers on the plane are also at risk, especially the ones sitting near him.'
b"It means that the entire plane is now at moderate risk of exposure if he's infected, and the people sitting in the rows near his (which share the same air circulation loop) are at high risk."
b'That moment your boggart shrinks to the size of a virus...'
b'In before the quarantine.\n\nEdit: \n\nIm in. \n\nOh shit. Oh fuck. Oh god.'
b'The mods need to take control of our country'
b'This is nonsensical, though.  Politicians are involved in the response.  Saying anything about their actions can be construed as "political", especially if  it\'s criticism of a politician you like.  It\'s impossible to have an open "non political" discussion about an issue of national and global importance.'
b"seems like he probably didn't know, and is now taking precaution (even though 11 days is likely a pretty good sign)."
b"If it's been that long, it's unlikely he has contracted it. The *median* span before symptoms appear from contact is 5 days. 11 days is more than double that.\n\nUnless he's in the very tip of the right tail of the bell curve, he's probably not infected."
b'With the average age of his colleagues this could be worrisome.'
b'Something tells me he has had a mild cough recently, and that was the key to decision he made.'
b'~~If he is asymptomatoc, he is very unlikely to spread, according to the studies I know of, asmyptomatic spread is there, but very very rarely and starts shortly before the symptoms start, so catching itneraction early and then quaratine until at least two weeks sicne interaction is still very much helpful.~~\n\nEDIT: THIS IS DIPSUTED, THERE ARE CONFLICING SOURCES ON ASYMPTOMATOC SPREAD!'
b'Pretty much'
b"Couldn't he have gotten tested?"
b'They disinfect, then all the kids who were in class with the kid/teacher are back in that school a day later, after being exposed to the person who was sick causing school closure to begin with. \n\nAnd at this point here in King County Washington (the epicenter of US deaths and confirmed cases) tell us there is no point in testing so they pretty much are not testing anymore. So no (or VERY VERY limited) testing is even going on  here where things are pretty out of control.  \n\nNo testing means there will be no more school closures as they are only closing with confirmed cases. \n\nSound fucked up enough for yet?'

b'Some say "hoax" and "go on living my life" are two different things. Some.'
b"Not only this, we also can't pretend the anti-science crowd is all right wing. Maybe it *used* to be that way, but I'm seeing anti-vaxxers even among liberals. I don't think it's partisan, either."
b"But they believe it exists. I'm talking about people who literally believe the virus either does not exist or was made in a lab by evil scientists or Bill Gates."
b"Idiots' run..."
b"> (not everyone will as 80% cases are mild)\n\nJust read this [super-interesting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-china-aylward.html) from the NY Times interviewing the head of the WHO who recently went to check out response to CV19 in China.\n\nIt seems that 'mild' includes extremely ill people with full-blown pneumonia, the 'severe' cases are those who need to be on ventilators and so on in order to survive.\n\nThe word 'mild' sounds like  a bad cold - but it is way worse than that."
b'You are not spelling that antiviral correctly. It is also already available and used in treatments. People still die'
b'The reality of the situation is that regardless of what happens - Say a vaccine is found. Easy and cost-effective treatments developed - The core ideas of how not to get it are just generally good ideas. \n\nKeep a stocked pantry of dry goods. Wash your fucking hands. Try not to touch your face. \n\nThese are solid principles for just about any kind of communicable disease or large scale disaster.'
b"People don't get the basic mathematics of it. Because there's no vaccine. It's going to continue to spread exponentially. Probably. They should quarantine everyone for two weeks but we don't have a leader who is strong enough to do that. They would rather do serious damage than take a short term hit to the economy."
b'Yeah. Pretty much this coulda been a tragic and rough thing to deal with but had we taken it serious and taken necessary actions we would be in better shape long term \n\nInstead we have the idiot masses thinking shits all lovely and continue on as if this really is the flu and in turn creating a bigger shit storm.'
b"Ironically, they were only able to do that because he was trying to work with them for the sake of the country's long-term political health.\n\nHis biggest mistake was expecting the GOP to govern in good faith, and as far as I'm concerned, that will forever taint *their* legacy, not his."
b'Yup... Oh, the tantrums they threw.. Government shut down anyone?'
b'How many wars did Obama get us into? They were against him on some things but he was totally with them on many others.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m excited too just for the spectacle of it. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I want it to happen or that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it away if I could.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s like driving past a horrific car crash, and looking because you can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself.'
b">It could be a defense mechanism. I sometimes slip into feeling weirdly excited, like I'm watching a work of fiction play out in real life. But I snap back to reality \n\nProbably mild dissociation, which is indeed a defense mechanism. Derealization is a form of dissociation where you feel like you're watching a movie."
b"> But I snap back to reality and I'm terrified for my parents, especially my dad.\n\nYeah, my parents are my biggest concern. They are in their 70s and relatively healthy but still."
b"You need to visit social media more then, it's pretty much everywhere."
b'Except that contradicts them saying she has "mild illness."'
b"Early on I assumed that this country would handle the pandemic fairly well because I assumed that our healthcare system was much better than most countries, and that we had a good track record of taking care of outbreaks like h1n1. Boy was I wrong. I'm sorry that you're getting reamed in the ass even though you're just trying to help"

b"So the flu like symptoms I my family of 3 have been having for months, and my negative flu test, might mean this has been going on a lot longer?  I never get sick but have had flu like symptoms for 2+ months now. Same with my son and wife but they have allergies so that can explain that, especially since he's been sick off and on since september-pre/early pneumonia?  Her bronchitis.  But both were told they had allergies first and the treatments never worked.  Now I'm being told there is a rash of sinus infections.  \n\nNot to be too much of a hypochondriac, but should I be worried?   My next step was getting mold specialists to check my vents but I'm poor."
b'Holy shit that\xe2\x80\x99s me. I had the flu shot. Got the flu. Started coughing up blood. Now recovering from pneumonia. Requested flu testing and they refused (I wanted to rule out COVID19). I\xe2\x80\x99m 34. Very fit and healthy. It\xe2\x80\x99s been hell. I then went to my physician to request to be tested and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me a reason the doctor at the ER wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t test me. (Bay Area).\n\nStay healthy, folks.'

b'FDA regulations have been waived.  The issue with the kit is that its fucked up.  One of the chemicals was incorrect.  BTW, the only reason they went with their own, more expensive kit is because of the profits.  Lots and lots of money here.  They have $$$$ in their eyes.  Corrupt fucks.'
b"WHO-approved, German-made test kits don't line American Pharma pockets."
b"Yeah, it's pretty amazing that China bought the US two months advanced warning, and the US did absolutely nothing during these crucial time, no stockpile of protective gear or test kits,"

Do we just lose our Jobs and our house or go on living life since at this point all we have a clearly lingering illness... but at least not we can get out of bed'
b'I believe 16 have died there now.'
b'The US did pledge an emergency 8.1 billion to this outbreak, with 3 billion towards a vaccine. Most vaccines cost about 200 million or so to develop so hopefully we can find a cure quickly.    \n     \nAlso, no one knew how serious it would be, if you look at SARS and MERS, if we created a US pandemic response it would be a lot of wasted money; we see it\xe2\x80\x99s over here now. We need to stop harping on woulda, coulda, shoulda, and move forward to clamp it down.   \n    \nWe need more state involvement though. Everyone wants to blame the federal government, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have federal healthcare. The states need to also do their part in this. Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t WA state shut down businesses, public gathers, and imposed their own quarantine? Because they are afraid of the impact as well.    \n    \nThe state could easily cancel all national guard and reserve training for a few weeks, reallocate some funding that was for less essential priorities, and start doing something about this as well.'
b"Just saw a video about random sampling tests in my country, wouldn't be useful if mild or asymptomatics never tested positive."
b'Not that I disagree, and he should be tested anyway, but to be fair, the definition of "mild" includes people who have fevers, coughs, etc that the public would generally call "sick". It basically just means they don\'t need intensive care. So that inflates those numbers a whole lot...'

b"I'm not sure what he said, but even if he said that, it doesn't matter in this context, you're just changing the goal posts.\n\nYour argument is focused on what he said, and if he said what you claimed, he is a hypocrite and I agree.\n\nMy argument is not focused at all on what he said or who is he as a person, my argument is that by staying home and self-quarantining, he's being socially responsible rather than having an ulterior motive behind staying at home. Your argument is completely irrelevant to what I said."
b"Thank you for verifying this! This is exactly what I understood but because we aren't really testing in the US I wanted to make sure. I do not understand what is going on here with not doing testing. It's very unsettling."
b'He actually flew on a normal plane?'
b"That's what I hate about this. You never know when it's gonna hit you."

b'This thing can stay in you for 24 days.'
b"I'm expecting there to be an outbreak among US leadership before too long.

Whether you believe in the findings of the Mueller investigation or not, I hope you understand the Russians are absolutely invested in dividing Americans and making us hate one another.

b'Actually the US reacted very slowly to H1N1 and did little to nothing to try to contain it. That\xe2\x80\x99s not directly a healthcare system issue but definitely a piece of the puzzle. Now that another virus is around we are doing the same thing again and but this time not even trying to test for it anymore while it runs wild throughout the community.'
b"Cant wait for our non-authoritarian gov't try what China did. Forced quarantines will probably not work around here. It'll be quite bad, since I see no alternative.\n\nEdit: and no. Our healthcare system is actually behind. We pay thousands for a damn ambulance ride."

b'The media in this country is useless. They get all their info from AP and Reuters and they focus so much on spin and countering fox news. HHS had a whistleblower that told everyone how unprepared we were. The staff to investigate this is led by political appointees and has been cut to 10% of what is was. The CDC staff was forced to drag these other people and they had the wrong gear so probably wound up spreadhing the viris and bringing it here.

b"Personally, I think it is important to trace contact points. If you know someone has covid-19 and they were asymptomatic and were in the community or went to work, you should test persons who have been in contact with the infected. Then you can isolate and avoid further spreading. Putting your head in the sand and pretending that people can't possibly be infected is plain stupid.\n\nI agree random sampling makes no sense, but we are talking about a situation where someone was in direct contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19."

Of course, everyone that knew him beyond Apprentice knew this but the vast majority of his supporters only know the TV personality.\n\nMany people have pointed out that the flu is worse, and diabetes is worse and heart disease is worse but none of those things is this administration's fault due to inaction... But this virus definitely is entirely on the Trump administration because they are all too stupid to just get the fuck out of the way and let the professionals handle it.\n\nJust the fact that he goes on TV daily to talk about how great he is or how smart he is - proves he is neither of these things."
b"But for about 20% of infected people in my country they have no clue where they got it, so I think it's already too late for that here, I don't think it can be stopped effectively with that method."

b'Please avoid off-topic political discussions.\n\nOur policy on political posts is as follows:\n\nThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned.'

b">At some point you have to wonder how this country can successfully compete with healthier more educated nations.\n\nBecause it's great if you are rich. We literally have the best medical technology and best medical personnel in the world bar none, no one even comes close.\n\nBut you only get access to it if you are rich."
b"Life expectancy has almost nothing to do with healthcare.\n\nAmericans die earlier than people from other developed nations because they're fatter, more sedentary, more violent, more likely to die in a car crash, etc. And the decrease in life expectancy was fentanyl."
b"We just import those higher educated with higher salaries.  Those that stayed here clearly didn't pull themselves up by their bootstraps enough.  \n\nI'd love to put '/s' in, but it's really just reality."
b"1. Consolidation and vertical integration of pharmaceutical suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors is probably the number one cause of cost increases. Pharma manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies  all are out there to profit, and a incredibly complex web of entities makes sure that no one has any price transparency. Very few players means little competition, and the complexity means huge barriers to entry keep anyone else out. \n2. We tend to overuse and over charge for diagnostic tests that may not be needed in some cases. This is partly to reduce risk of lawsuits as we are very litigious against doctors. But also hospitals encourage high usage of these tests to help make up for the losses they are required legally to take on by caring for the uninsured. Hospitals sometimes take losses on doctors salaries because they know if they employ them, they can force them to use their diagnostic facilities. \n3. Palliative care is viewed as a defeat. We don't encourage patients to define before hand the extent of intervention they desire, so we do everything we can to keep them alive, even beyond what would be comfortable or perhaps desirable for the patient. \n4. The model health care is paid for is generally by the amount of service provided. We are just staring to incorporate health care outcomes into how these services are paid for (this was thanks to Obama and the ACA). Without incorporating quality of outcomes and utilization into the payment model, lots of unnecessary care was encouraged by the model itself. \n5. Massive administrative overhead due to a  system with multiple insurance companies\n6. Lack of good technological standards to help share information effectively. The ACA somewhat helped with this, but the software and standards out there are still incredibly primitive. \n\nThere are no doubt other major factors but these are a few I know well enough to explain."
b'Probably bc we don\xe2\x80\x99t do preventative healthcare. It saves a lot more money if you catch stuff at early stages rather than going to the ER when things get super serious. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'CDC has and was always one of the top groups to fight this sort of shit.. This is 100% caused by Trump putting a lacky "yes man" as head of CDC and then telling him to keep the numbers down...'
b'why else'
b'I think with the list of people responsible there are people much further ahead of them as far as responsibility. Starting with CDC and not having enough tests and not provising any adidtional resources for patient care for weeks. then whoever decided not to use WHO Tests. the blood is on their hands.'
b'I like that analogy'
b"Reminds me of the part in animal farm when the horse finally realizes that he's going off to the glue farm and starts to furiously kick at the door of his moving stall to get out"
b"Yes and no. You can't stop it, but earlier, faster treatment and a better handle on statistics for macro management are huge."
b'*Salutes you in passing*'
b'You know that Nancy is 6 years older than Trump? And Pence is a decently young 60 year old. I think she needs to be the most worried out of the 3.'
b'Hahaha \xf0\x9f\x98\x84'
b"Some might say that's a blessing in disguise..."
b'Um... from the article:\n\n>(Question): What were mild, severe and critical? We think of \xe2\x80\x9cmild\xe2\x80\x9d as like a minor cold.\n\n>> (Answer): No. **\xe2\x80\x9cMild\xe2\x80\x9d was a positive test, fever, cough \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen.** \xe2\x80\x9cSevere\xe2\x80\x9d was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. \xe2\x80\x9cCritical\xe2\x80\x9d was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.'
b'Really I define it as\n\nMild 80% - Can be treated at home\n\nSevere 16% - Needs to be hospitalized\n\nCritical 4% - Needs an ICU bed with ventilators\n\nThe 80% cases while it may be shit for the people going through are not going to  a)kill them b) overwhelm the medical infrastructure and kill other people like say those with heart attacks who cant get an ICU bed as all ventilators are being used for COVID patients.\n\nSo the 80% does not worry me. Its the 20% needing hospital beds is what worries me. \n\nFor comparison the Flu numbers are 90% not needing hospitalization,2% needing ventilators and .1% dying.\n\nIts a very very very bad flu season and the hospital infrastructure in the US can barely handle a very bad flu season.\n\nFurther these percentages are not even across age groups. For those over 80, its 60% needing hopitalization, 50% on ventilators and 15% dying.\n\nUSA does not have a culture of triage where you decide that the veiitlator and ICU bed needs to be kept available for in case you get a 30 yr old car accident victim by letting the 80 yr old Covid patient die so all ICU beds will get used up for the 80 yr olds.'
b"Don't you think that the fact that heads of agencies like the CDC being appointed based on political merit is a bigger issue?"
b'Hey idiot, Corona is also really bad in countries with different governments. You are coping, we cannot contain this.'
b'Haha, I think you are right'
b'I think if you get pneumonia you won\xe2\x80\x99t be thinking it is mild.'
b"Trump, against all norms, politicized a bunch of previously non-political roles in the administration. This is a fault of our modern politics that we elect someone would do that and don't hold them accountable. \n\nNo system is immune to corruption under those circumstances."
b'Since when? Trump may have done this but the previous administration, like many before it, hired exceptionally qualified people when and where possible. Not political hacks.'
b'Is not testing people who are possible sick supposed to help the situation?'

b"Not funny, but it sort of feels like we're in a Sim, and this is literally one of those messages that pops up as the happy face slides from green to yellow, to red...and then you get civil unrest."
b" UPDATE\n\n### More on the Italy prison riot\n\n**Earlier on we mentioned a riot in Modena prison where six people died. Here's some more information on the incident.**\n\nThe riot started on Sunday when sixty inmates set the prison on fire in an attempt to escape, according to Corriere de Bologna. They had been told that relatives and friends were banned from visiting due to the lockdown.\n\nLaw enforcement officers managed to stop 500 prisoners from escaping.\n\nHowever, some were able to raid the infirmary for methadone and other drugs, a source told the [**Corriere Della Sera.**](https://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/bologna/cronaca/20_marzo_09/coronavirus-emilia-romagna-sei-morti-rivolta-carcere-modena-f2c9dcce-61e5-11ea-82aa-d3821fde97d4.shtml)\n\nAuthorities are investigating the incident."
b'Trapped in a cage, no chance to see family, people getting sick and dying around you. Nightmare fuel.'
b"Very sad news. It's an unfortunate situation; obviously they want to see their families and vice versa, but if the disease hits a prison it could be absolutely devastating."
b"Societal stress starting to show and it's only been 2 days of quarantine. It starts with prisons of course, but let's see how long the rest of society holds up until violence flairs up. I hope not but Western peoples are not used to these measures."
b'Shit, I feel bad for Italy'
b"I hate to see what is going on here, they all have family. I cannot wrap my head around how complicated a few things are getting right now. All of these boiling points about to break. Let them all free? Let them all die? Spend resources that are needed for children's hospitals on criminals? Im so sorry for anyone that has to deal with any of these hard choices that they have to make and that will be made for them. Noone makes it out of life alive but it just kind of sucks knowing how bad it has to be for others. I love all of you even my homies in the pen!!!"
b'You know how people are saying watch cruise ships for a real time CFR? Prisons are what we should be watching for an idea of real time social collapse in quarantine.'
b'My guess is Italy is 1 to 2 weeks ahead of the US in the progression of the pandemic. I would be very happy if you prove me wrong.'
b'There is video conferencing available.'
b"I'm Italian and I live near Milan. Same thing happening here, prisoners are rioting on the roofs setting things on fire, police and army is everywhere."
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen when prisons have mass outbreaks and guards refuse to go to work? Frightening stuff.'
b"Fuck. Did not realise there were so many deaths. \n\nCrazy how quick a civilised society can begin to crack under extreme pressure. \n\nThis disease can wreak havoc if left unchecked, Italy had less than ten cases a few weeks ago, now there's hundreds dead and deadly prison riots.\n\nI don't have a god to pray to but I really hope things improve soon in Italy."

b'What\xe2\x80\x99s scarier than the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a sim is that modern people are so sheltered and naive that they think bad things happening is weird and means we\xe2\x80\x99re in a sim.\n\nHow about your life has always been extraordinarily easy?'

b"It might be better if they just gave all these guys smartphones, laptops, tablets and free access to all the internet and internet streaming services they want ...

b'We\xe2\x80\x99re all next'
b'You love killers,thieves and rapists? How ignorant do you have to be?'
b'No they\xe2\x80\x99re not. Prison keeps people who are deemed to be unfit for life in a society. The only thing it will show is a worst case scenario.'
b'Prisons as a sample of social collapse is not a good metric. By definition they are a subset deemed to not be compatible with society at large and seperated from them.'
b'What is a CFR?'
b'No. Not at all. Personality disorders, psychotic disorders, and physical maladies are much higher among the prison population. In prisons its estimated to have 20-30% Antisocial Personality Disorder (versus 1-2% in general population). Communicable diseases are common as well. You have people who have a higher threshold and propensity for violence and limited ways to self-isolate unless you are placed in administrative segregation. Showers are taken together. Closed quarters living is the norm. Handwashing is not.'
b"It isn't USA."
b'The prisoners got access to the medical supplies (methodone) apparently'

b"> I literally just said the same thing to a friend. The news feed looks like the one from Plague Inc.

But shiit, I have no idea tbh."
b"Seriously, these replies are absolutely blowing my mind. Widespread civil unrest, and worse, are the reality for so many other nations around the world. We're just used to consuming it as entertainment."

b'Great observation.'
b'good job. now you have an excuse not to feel sorry for them'
b'[deleted]'
b'do you really think all prisoners are murderers?'
b'Likewise.'
b"Wow, sensitive much? I think 6 dead at a prison is a sign of societal stress in response to the limitations, do you think this is normal in Italy? It's not. Nobody is talking like it's the end times.\n\nAs for the potential for violence, yeah I absolutely think *some* Westerners might get violent in a quarantine situation. Europeans and especially Italians don't like being told what to do by the government. A quarantine is a major restrictive order on civil liberties."
b'Grouping a thief with killers and rapists seems a bit off.\n\nIf one of my family members was in prison for being a thief, I would certainly still love them.'
b'The biggest thieves are white collar criminals. Just wage theft alone is bigger than all types of street theft combined.'

b"Quarantining a prison during a virus outbreak isn't unethical."
b"Wait, you're calling him naive because he said there *are* drugs in jail?\n\nThe irony here is palpable."
b"I mean you're correct in that there are drugs in prisons but no need to be condescending."
b"Are you stating that there's no drugs in prisons? Or maybe was Burt\\_93 the one saying it.\n\nAnyway, there are a lot of drugs inside because most of the people who end up on jail are drug addicts, so the guards are kinda ok with that to avoid more behavioral problems than what they already have."
b'Nope, some are rapists, arsonists, women beaters, violent people, thieves, people who commited fraud and ruined other people.'
b'Wait, is it Italy quarantined? How have I missed it? I live inside those areas and except for limitations on social life, I can still go wherever I want.

b"Where I live we're not isolated yet, but I know that at the north they're offering internet services for free, like Netflix or amazon, so it is possible something will be done for food too."
b'The problem was there from years. The Coronavirus just made it explode.\n\nPrisons in Italy are overcrowded, and the problem was just ignored by the government. An italian judge once said, that at the first chance of "rising emergency", this would happen. \n\nOnce you remove the only chance to see your beloved ones until the 31st of May, you had just awake a sleeping bear, and rioting is assured.\n\nThe Army and Police are worried that Mafia gangsters and boss in these prisons can run away, even if they are in isolation. Actually, of the 23 concerned prisons, only a couple of them were full-scale riots. In the other cases, like San Vittore, prisoners and their families are protesting rather peacefully. Just an hour ago, I was watching live the San Vittore "Riots" and the prisoners on the roof were just talking to the head of police and the firemen.'
b'You would think so.\nIt is also a possibility that they were just looking for an excuse to riot. The coronavirus situation gave them a chance, and they took it.'
b'Until you realize that the 15 minutes you get to see your family is the only time you will see(maybe even talk to) them for the week or maybe whole month. It can be there only connection to their lives in the outside world.'
b"Prison inmates don't think rationally.  They want their visits because they are helpful and they look forward to them each week and they dont care of the consequences that will bring.  In their eyes, the govt has em locked up against their will and will pay for everything anyway.  The same thing will happen in the US."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s actually organized crime and their families trying to get the prisons to mass pardon everyone so they can go home.  Other stories on it'
b"First one of this magnitude and scope (in 100+ years)... It's also been covered extensively in popular fiction (a lot of you also include zombie outbreaks). \n\nSo, it's all a pretty common 'topic' in fiction/non-fiction, so plenty of 'source material'."
b"Doesn't mean you shouldn't have some sympathy for them."
b'Many stupid people on the internet  who have no reading comprehension lol'
b'[deleted]'
b"Oh, you never leave your village? That's fine. Some of us travel places for work or pleasure and find restrictions telling us that we cannot leave a certain area to be highly restrictive (not that it's uncalled for). Nothing changed? Yeah, ok, sure, maybe for you. Different lives, different realities."
b"Lol, wow. And you're the one telling me to chill. And with bolded letters for dramatic flair!"
b'Of course, I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t personally known anyone who is in that situation so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it.  I know plenty of thieves lmao.'
b"But just like prisons they're not spread out equally eh."
b'Prisons in the USA are overcrowded as well. My county jail is holding half again as many prisoners as it was designed to hold.'
b'Italian prison guards should have told them that two or three prisons in China have been infected, hundreds of prisoners have been infected.'
b'> First one of this magnitude and scope (in 100+ years).\n\nSpoiler, its not. Asian Flu and hong kong was **massive**. We also have other problems that still classifies as massive but H1N1 and AIDS. Want me to go on? Or you dont consider these real problems?'
b"Suspending prison visits is no reason for a normal person to be setting things on fire.  A normal person's reaction would be to be bummed and go read a book or something and hope things get better."
b'Right, he was saying that no drugs is the issue that would really upset the inmates.\n\nAnd then you said he was from another planet.\n\nKeep digging..'
b"Alright, you have a new account and shit. Yeah I'm done discussing with people that have an agenda. Wish you all the best"
b"None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type\n\nAsia/Hong Kong were both severe but fairly localised by comparison, H1N1 had far lower transmission rates, and AIDs is spread in a totally different way so isn't relevant at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is looking to be as big as Spanish Flu in terms of infection, mortality will likely be a far lower rate due to medical advances, but in absolute terms this could kill more."
b'All of those diseases are fucking nothing compared to this lol, how some people still fail to see the path this is going to take baffles me.'
b"How many borders closed for either of those above cases?\n\nHow many kids were out of school compared with the currently 300 million+kids? \n\nWhat was the economic impact compared with this one? All chinese production is currently stopped. Medical ingredients for pharma made in China, shipped to india to make the Meds then to America aren't being manufactured. So a medicine shortage is likely. \n\nLots of shortages are likely. I've never seen ANYTHING like this, in my 40+ years. Have you? H1N1 was hyped and on the news a lot, but it wasn't as communicable...\n\nEdit: Events likely canceled include: SXSW (30 years, first time cancelled), Olympics (when were these cancelled by an outbreak?), etc..."
b'Multiplication factors differ. In terms of combo spreading/mortality this is the biggest we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the past century.'

b'There was a time before people knew how AIDS was transmitted. Even after it was known, people HIV+ were shunned. People absolutely were panicked about getting AIDS.'
b'> Asia/Hong Kong were both severe but fairly localised by comparison, H1N1 had far lower transmission rates, and AIDs is spread in a totally different way so isn\'t relevant at all.\n\nAre you for real? Are you above 20 and cant recon the amount of panic AIDS brought to the world then I\'m baffled tbh. That\'s something everyone should know.\n\nAsia and Hong kong you\'re just wrong about. You\'re literally in my field talking to me and trying to convice me how these outbreaks was "fairly localised". Alright.\n\nH1N1 we can talk a lot about and the numbers you\'re seeing today is not what numbers we saw during the outbreak, just like today?\n\n>This is looking to be as big as Spanish Flu in terms of infection, mortality will likely be a far lower rate due to medical advances, but in absolute terms this could kill more.\n\nCare to elaborate?\n\nEdit: It\'s funny because you\'re saying "None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type". Then you go on to say that AIDS is different etc. You do reckon which topic we\'re on right? What we know today is not relevant to how people reacted back then.'
b"> All of those diseases are fucking nothing compared to this lol, how some people still fail to see the path this is going to take baffles me.\n\nYou're saying that AIDS, H1N1, asian flu and hong kong flu was nothing compared to what we're seeing today? Are you for real? you must have a special narrative for what youre trying to push.\n\nBut still. My point is that we didnt know the numbers, how it spread, r0 til after the outbreak was done. And with AIDS people thought many different things before."
b"So what you're telling me is that we as a society have succeeded with better solutions etc? Seriously, you see what you want to see. We're literally watching the same thing unfold but while you see it as panic that these things are happening, I take it for granted for what I would want to see in a country/society year 2020. With our technology, reach with social media, giving so many people a voice, aircrafts with disinfectshit etc I would be so devastated if we didnt do anything at all to save these people. There is so much we can do today that we couldn't 1950 or so, why is it negative that we do it?"
b'Alright, show me the source for your claim then.'
b'> Seriously, what is wrong with you\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nEdit: For real tho. Why is it ok for doomers to say they wont talk with new account because chinaxD but I cant say the same about them? I dont understand tbh'
b"Yes I was around for the AIDS panic, doesn't sound like you were if you think it is transmitted in any way like the flu? \n\nIt was  primarily moral panic in the West, with vast amounts of ignorance and homophobia/racism behind it. This isn't that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure what you want me to elaborate on...the stats so far show transmission at Spanish Flu levels or thereabouts, but we have 7 times more people on the planet now. So if it were to infect the same % of population, but have a lower mortality rate, it could still easily cover the 50m that are attributed to Spanish Flu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe transmission stats are fact (based on current best evidence) the other two statements are obviously conjecture"
b"I've heard this has the possiblility of infecting 60-80% of the population... \n\nThat's like 5 billion or so people. At a conservative 2% mortality rate, that's 100,000,000 deaths. \n\nThis does NOT include those who die from starvation because of economic collapses, or those who can't get an ICU bed because they're all taken, etc...or medical scarcity of supplies like prescription drugs which also causes the weakest of society to suffer/die. \n\nBest case scenario, I think we end up w/ half these numbers because our govt's get their shit together, but some countries probably won't and it'll be worse there. I'm not an epidemiologist, but even w/ a vaccine will this possibly spin up w/ multiple variations every few years and need new vaccines? Will it cause more death at each spin up? Could this be the new normal? \n\nThe best assumptions right now are that hospital beds will be at max capacity in the USA by May 8th. After that, good luck if you have a life threatening emergency either COVID related or non-COVID related. \n\nHow many might die from COVID who'd survive IF they had ventilators/ICU beds available? I think we're gonna find out soon enough how bad this really will be, by May."
b"Just started watching today's video from [this dude](https://youtu.be/UVTyl7Y4IMo). He explicitly states that this is the worst health epidemic he's seen since beginning to practice in the 70s and goes into detail about why."
b"I'm saying exactly what I said/meant... SCOPE and SEVERITY of this outbreak hasn't been matched in 100+ years - not since the spanish flu. \n\nWe've just been lucky. My point being is, this could be just as deadly as that one was, no plague/etc since the Spanish Flu has scared the shit out of me like this one is... \n\nI mean if you get this, you could have irreparable lung damage, or the inability to breath consciously/autonomously. Not to mention, possibly other things we don't even know about yet, or if it mutates --who knows what it will be capable of. \n\nThis is the big one of  (my lifetime at least), as a 40 year old. \n\nNot denigrating Aids, etc, but mode of transmission for previous illnesses were a lot slower/harder/etc, this one on average each person getting it gives it to 2.4-2.9 people...which causes it to double every 6 days. \n\nThe USA isn't doing crap to curtail this, they aren't even testing or allowing tests. NY has the labs in place for 2k tests/day but the CDC isn't allowing them to test. It's as if the government wants to kill it's own, instead of risk having huge #'s of infections being reported."
b"The point is not Asian flu infected more people overall, Hong kong killed hundreds of thousands, SARS was more deadly, AIDS caused panic. \n\nThe point is if we let this get to the same scale as these others and beyond (and containment is harder because R0 is very high and human transmission is very easy), the damage, in terms of human lives, could be huge.\n\nThe point is not what it is now, it is where it's all heading in a year's time. It may be slowed down by warmer weather, the virus may weaken, it may become less contagious and so on...but we can't bank on such hopes."
b'I made an edit in my former post, I\'ll just post that.\n\nIt\'s funny because you\'re saying "None of the things you mentioned were on this scale or type". Then you go on to say that AIDS is different etc. You do reckon which topic we\'re on right? What we know today is not relevant to how people reacted back then.\n\nPlese go back and read our thread. You\'re talking about things we know today. I dont see how that\'s relevant.'
b"> I've heard this has the possiblility of infecting 60-80% of the population...\n\nSource? You do realize that your post is invalid if you cant provide an actual source for that number right? Since you've based your entire post on bad math. Last I've heard was from Marc Lipsitch with 40-70% but he changed that to 20-60%. I'm not saying youre wrong per se, but please provide source."
b'Ok?'
b'Still no source'
b"I've noticed that people do NOT understand how the stimulus checks being sent to Americans work. There's so much misinformation out there.\n\nAll adults with social security numbers and income under 75k (150k for married filing jointly) qualify to get 1,200 (2,400 for couples) plus 500 per child under 17. People who make between 75k and 99k (150k to 198k for married) get reduced amounts. They lose 5 dollars for every 100 dollars in income above the amount.\n\nPeople who receive social security benefits and don't file tax returns still will get checks. The IRS will use SSA1099 to verify their income.\n\nThere is no longer any reduction for making under a certain amount. I see this posted often where people think you need to make a certain amount of money. You don't.\n\nYou do need to file taxes or have a SSA1099. That's the rub. If someone never files for whatever reason, and doesn't get a SSA1099, they won't see a check.\n\nNow here's where I see the most confusion... The check is an advance of a 2020 tax credit. They will base checks on 2019 or 2018 returns because they need a reasonable estimate, but when you file your 2020 tax return, the amount will get recalculated based on 2020 income.\n\nWhat does this mean? People who don't file 2018 or 2019 could still get the money next year if they file a 2020 return! If someone makes too much to qualify using 2019 numbers, but makes less in 2020 and qualifies, they will get the money when they file 2020 taxes. And if someone gets a check but then ends up being above the income limits on 2020, they'll have to pay the money back. Things like marriage, divorce, etc will ask be rectified once taxes are filled next year.\n\nAlso, the money is not taxable! Tax credits don't affect income. Anyone who says we'll all have to pay the money back next year is full of it. ETA: It can't increase the amount of tax you owe in any way. \n\nHere's some great sources:\n\nThis one in particular really explains the tax ramifications: \nwww.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2020/03/25/congress-reaches-agreement-on-a-coronavirus-relief-package-tax-aspects-of-the-cares-act/\n\nwww.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\n\nwww.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/25/congress-to-send-taxpayers-1200-checks-in-the-wake-of-coronavirus.html"
b"I would urge all of you, whether you think it's causing you anxiety or not, to be cautious of the amount of time you spend engaging with the news in general and this subreddit in particular.\n\nIt's not healthy to be spending hours every day reading a constant stream of pessimistic takes about how the world is ending. Focus on what you can control - stay home, encourage people close to you to do the same."
b'I\'m not a doctor, but I\'ve worked for one for more than 14 years, and have known him for 20. He\'s a personal friend, and he passed this along to me from a colleague working in New Orleans. This is their experience with treating patients - what works, what doesn\'t. \n\nI\'ve also talked with another friend who is a local physician working in an ICU in Fort Worth, and sent him this last night. He said that they are rationing N95 masks - one per week. An epidemiologist friend is also going back to work for the Texas state health department - they need all the help they can get right now.\n\nThere are people who still think that this is just a bad flu. It\'s not. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am an ER MD in New Orleans. Class of 98. Every one of my colleagues have now seen several hundred Covid 19 patients and this is what I think I know.\n\nClinical course is predictable.\n\n2-11 days after exposure (day 5 on average) flu like symptoms start. Common are fever, headache, dry cough, myalgias(back pain), nausea without vomiting, abdominal discomfort with some diarrhea, loss of smell, anorexia, fatigue.\n\nDay 5 of symptoms- increased SOB, and bilateral viral pneumonia from direct viral damage to lung parenchyma.\n\nDay 10- Cytokine storm leading to acute ARDS and multiorgan failure. You can literally watch it happen in a matter of hours.\n\n81% mild symptoms, 14% severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, 5% critical.\n\nPatient presentation is varied. Patients are coming in hypoxic (even 75%) without dyspnea. I have seen Covid patients present with encephalopathy, renal failure from dehydration, DKA. I have seen the bilateral interstitial pneumonia on the xray of the asymptomatic shoulder dislocation or on the CT\'s of the (respiratory) asymptomatic polytrauma patient. Essentially if they are in my ER, they have it. Seen three positive flu swabs in 2 weeks and all three had Covid 19 as well. Somehow this \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* has told all other disease processes to get out of town.\n\nChina reported 15% cardiac involvement. I have seen covid 19 patients present with myocarditis, pericarditis, new onset CHF and new onset atrial fibrillation. I still order a troponin, but no cardiologist will treat no matter what the number in a suspected Covid 19 patient. Even our non covid 19 STEMIs at all of our facilities are getting TPA in the ED and rescue PCI at 60 minutes only if TPA fails.\n\n**Diagnostic**\n\nCXR- bilateral interstitial pneumonia (anecdotally starts most often in the RLL so bilateral on CXR is not required). The hypoxia does not correlate with the CXR findings. Their lungs do not sound bad. Keep your stethoscope in your pocket and evaluate with your eyes and pulse ox.\n\nLabs- WBC low, Lymphocytes low, platelets lower then their normal, Procalcitonin normal in 95%\n\nCRP and Ferritin elevated most often. CPK, D-Dimer, LDH, Alk Phos/AST/ALT commonly elevated.\n\nNotice D-Dimer- I would be very careful about CT PE these patients for their hypoxia. The patients receiving IV contrast are going into renal failure and on the vent sooner.\n\nBasically, if you have a bilateral pneumonia with normal to low WBC, lymphopenia, normal procalcitonin, elevated CRP and ferritin- you have covid-19 and do not need a nasal swab to tell you that.\n\nA ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count greater than 3.5 may be the highest predictor of poor outcome. the UK is automatically intubating these patients for expected outcomes regardless of their clinical presentation.\n\nAn elevated Interleukin-6 (IL6) is an indicator of their cytokine storm. If this is elevated watch these patients closely with both eyes.\n\nOther factors that appear to be predictive of poor outcomes are thrombocytopenia and LFTs 5x upper limit of normal.\n\n**Disposition**\n\nI had never discharged multifocal pneumonia before. Now I personally do it 12-15 times a shift. 2 weeks ago we were admitting anyone who needed supplemental oxygen. Now we are discharging with oxygen if the patient is comfortable and oxygenating above 92% on nasal cannula. We have contracted with a company that sends a paramedic to their home twice daily to check on them and record a pulse ox. We know many of these patients will bounce back but if it saves a bed for a day we have accomplished something. Obviously we are fearful some won\'t make it back.\n\nWe are a small community hospital. Our 22 bed ICU and now a 4 bed Endoscopy suite are all Covid 19. All of these patients are intubated except one. 75% of our floor beds have been cohorted into covid 19 wards and are full. We are averaging 4 rescue intubations a day on the floor. We now have 9 vented patients in our ER transferred down from the floor after intubation.\n\nLuckily we are part of a larger hospital group. Our main teaching hospital repurposed space to open 50 new Covid 19 ICU beds this past Sunday so these numbers are with significant decompression. Today those 50 beds are full. They are opening 30 more by Friday. But even with the "lockdown", our AI models are expecting a 200-400% increase in covid 19 patients by 4/4/2020.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSupportive\n\nWorldwide 86% of covid 19 patients that go on a vent die. Seattle reporting 70%. Our hospital has had 5 deaths and one patient who was extubated. Extubation happens on day 10 per the Chinese and day 11 per Seattle.\n\nPlaquenil which has weak ACE2 blockade doesn\'t appear to be a savior of any kind in our patient population. Theoretically, it may have some prophylactic properties but so far it is difficult to see the benefit to our hospitalized patients, but we are using it and the studies will tell. With Plaquenil\'s potential QT prolongation and liver toxic effects (both particularly problematic in covid 19 patients), I am not longer selectively prescribing this medication as I stated on a previous post.\n\nWe are also using Azithromycin, but are intermittently running out of IV.\n\nDo not give these patient\'s standard sepsis fluid resuscitation. Be very judicious with the fluids as it hastens their respiratory decompensation. Outside the DKA and renal failure dehydration, leave them dry.\n\nProning vented patients significantly helps oxygenation. Even self proning the ones on nasal cannula helps.\n\nVent settings- Usual ARDS stuff, low volume, permissive hypercapnia, etc. Except for Peep of 5 will not do. Start at 14 and you may go up to 25 if needed.\n\nDo not use Bipap- it does not work well and is a significant exposure risk with high levels of aerosolized virus to you and your staff. Even after a cough or sneeze this virus can aerosolize up to 3 hours.\n\nThe same goes for nebulizer treatments. Use MDI. you can give 8-10 puffs at one time of an albuterol MDI. Use only if wheezing which isn\'t often with covid 19. If you have to give a nebulizer must be in a negative pressure room; and if you can, instruct the patient on how to start it after you leave the room.\n\nDo not use steroids, it makes this worse. Push out to your urgent cares to stop their usual practice of steroid shots for their URI/bronchitis.\n\nWe are currently out of Versed, Fentanyl, and intermittently Propofol. Get the dosing of Precedex and Nimbex back in your heads.\n\nOne of my colleagues who is a 31 yo old female who graduated residency last may with no health problems and normal BMI is out with the symptoms and an SaO2 of 92%. She will be the first of many.\n\nI PPE best I have. I do wear a MaxAir PAPR the entire shift. I do not take it off to eat or drink during the shift. I undress in the garage and go straight to the shower. My wife and kids fled to her parents outside Hattiesburg. The stress and exposure at work coupled with the isolation at home is trying. But everyone is going through something right now. Everyone is scared; patients and employees. But we are the leaders of that emergency room. Be nice to your nurses and staff. Show by example how to tackle this crisis head on. Good luck to us all.'
b"My dad has diabetes and just recently was admitted to the ICU and subsequently intubated. He tested positive for COVID-19. Although both my parents work in the medical field,  I never thought it would happen to my own family.\n\nI thought about going back to my hometown to visit him since he might not have much longer but I wasn't sure if that is a good idea since he did test positive. I'm hoping I'm overreacting. \n\nHe is: mid 50s, diabetic, works 16 hour shifts overnight. **Please send some positive news my way** as I'm currently an emotional mess as I try to finish assignments from my university as well as figure out the situation with my dad."

b"Our neighbor has died of COVID-19 today (Helsinki, Finland).\n\nIf you are still not self-isolating, and not taking this seriously - know that it was someone like you that killed him.\n\nSomeone who thought this is just the flu, someone who thought it only affects old people, someone who thought work is more important, someone who thought that it will all blow over in a few weeks, someone who thought it is the old people's job to stay at home, someone who kept doing what they were doing.\n\nThe virus does not spread. You spread it. The virus did not kill him - you did.\n\nSeven days ago, he was happy, full of energy, and without any symptoms.

Today - he is dead.\n\nToday, his wife is all alone in a house that nobody can visit. She will remain alone for 14 days or more.\n\nDon't let his death go unnoticed.

b'Does anyone feel exhausted with all of the conflicting sources of information? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who or what to trust anymore, I wish there was an objective answer, even if it was bleak.'
b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t fathom how flights are still flying out of NYC and domestically right now. We know what to do but we refuse to do it. Shut it all down for atleast a month.'
b"Well, thanks to the pandemic I had to take 2 days of PTO due to a temp of 99.3 from a golf ball sized armpit boil.\n\nHad I called out for an armpit boil last month, I would have gotten laughed at and told to come in.\n\nOur supervisors are 100% working from home while the pregnant lady with a doctor's note with CDC guidelines and her OBGYN'S strong recommendation that she work from home was denied her request. Also the woman who is 100% her child's caretaker was denied her request to work from home full time.\n\nBut our two supervisors are working from home all day, every day.\n\nSorry, this is my little salty vent."
b'The ease with which some people went from "it\'s not that serious, it\'s only killed 1 person" to "it\'s not that serious, it only killed 250 people yesterday" is kind of disturbing.'
b"I'm in Queens, NYC.\n\nLegitimately considering on abandoning my job. It would be a dick move, especially since I actually like my colleagues but I absolutely despite the risk that work (I'm a cashier) presents to my health and family. For minimum wage and no hazard pay, it's not worth it. We've been working overtime since we're short staffed.\n\nMy health of me and my family are finite. My job is disposable. I can't tell if I'm going to be making the smartest decision or the dumbest decision of my life. I rather stay at home with my family as much as possible to minimize the risk until this thing blows over. They'll be pissed at me and think I'm overreacting but I think the effects of prevention won't be seen but the effects of infection could be devastating.\n\nI like to think that I could get started in remote work. If that doesn't come through, I guess I could always get another minimum wage job once this thing blows over.\n\nWe have savings that could last us for about 2-3 months unemployed, possibly more if we are frugal enough."
b"Let's say an infected person coughs or sneezes in an elevator, and 5-10 minutes later I enter that elevator, can I get infected if I inhale the air in the elevator? How long would the virus particles stay in the air of an elevator to infect someone?"
b"One day this sub will be full of 'good news' flares"
b'So my elderly aunt just passed away two days ago.  She was in her 80s.  Her retirement home went on lockdown due to a few cases of corona virus discovered in her building.  The autopsy came back negative but due to the stay in your room order she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on her daily walks around the premises and her blood pressure fell from basically having to stay put. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad on so many levels, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get in there to help her and she had to pass away alone.  \n\nIt makes me wonder how many other deaths are occurring from the cascading effects of the pandemic.'
b"I don't even know how people are managing their anxiety anymore.  I was trying to use the low death rates for my age group (35 myself) to chill myself out but I can't even find any updated information on that kind of stuff anymore and every other news story I see is about a young, healthy person basically dropping dead.  Other than being a smoker (I just quit. I know it won't negate the damage done but hey might as well try) I have no other health conditions but still basically feel like I'm locked up in my house waiting to die."
b'Little update on the COVID 19 treatment front. Coronaviruses are very difficult to treat because the enzyme that the virus makes in cells to produce copies of itself has proofreading measures, normally antiviral drugs work by fooling the virus but the virus can get rid of these errors. we only have two known compounds known to bypass the proofreading function, Remdesivir which is currently in phase 3 trials and a new compound codenamed EIDD-2801. 2801 can be used orally but remdesivir can only be used intravenously. 2801 is going to get approval for phase 1 in a matter of weeks not months and we should have the preliminary remdesivir data on April 3 and the full report by April 27. Hopefully remdesivir proves useful and we can roll it out to hospitals who desperately need a treatment.'
b"Woke up today with a sore throat and a slight fever (99.7 degrees). No coughing yet but I feel like absolute shit and if I move my head too fast, I feel like my brain is rattling around in my skull.

There is nowhere to run to if we don\xe2\x80\x99t stand our ground and fight this now. I feel honored and privileged to be in a position to fight, to help, and to heal.

b"Hi all - I'm chiming in to share a google doc that i've started with the specific goal of keeping employers accountable for their treatment of employees during and after this pandemic. Like many of us, I've been sitting in my apartment browsing twitter over the past two weeks and every few hours another tweet or article pops up highlighting callous or greedy behavior by a company at the expense of its employees. There is so much coronavirus-related news coming out that it feels like this news is being washed away as quickly as it is reported.\n\nThis felt wrong to me - in a big way.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - there are a lot of layoffs and furloughs happening, and I understand that not all of them are unfair or abusive. I know that many businesses are going out of their way to take care of their employees as best they can, all while attempting to ensure that there is a business for those employees to return to once this is all over. Still, I think we need to know who is treating their employees poorly during this time and, more importantly, we need to remember those names and what they did after this pandemic is over. I'm asking for the following information: who is the company, what did they do, and a link to an article or tweet as proof.\n\nIf you don't want to post directly to the google doc you can DM me the info here or tweet at me - i'm also covidconfidential on twitter - and I would be happy to input it for you.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eA5aPZxNlIjy5RfWTBCbHjWjEPfgDlh8sbbhs-RSrHA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eA5aPZxNlIjy5RfWTBCbHjWjEPfgDlh8sbbhs-RSrHA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThanks in advance for your time, and stay healthy!"

b'Income rant: \nTLDR: STAY HOME!!\n\nFull story: \nI work at tiger burger, a resturaunt in hays, ellis co kansas.\n\nTonight hays had a "drag down main street" where people came from all over to drive and walk down main street, visiting businesses and bars along the way. We stayed open an hour and a half late we were so busy. While I am happy to see the business making money, and I am thankful to still have a job, I cant help but be worried and honestly kinda pissed.\n\n From the people calling ahead and paying with a card, I got zip codes from all over kansas, some from counties known to have covid cases. I gave food to multiple people who were coughing. Smokers? Common cold? Covid? Anybody\'s guess honestly. I saw people across the street at toby jugs, a bar, with their arms around each other drunk and singing. I had walk ins come in to get food talking about some crazy party they were at, and were going back to. \n\nThis is not social distancing.\n\nIf corona wasnt in ellis co yet, I am almost positive it is now. There were so many people walking around, they didnt stay in their cars. They went to restaurants, bars, house parties, grocery stores, and gas stations. This the exact opposite of what we should be doing. People keep treating this virus like a common cold and it is going to kill so many more people.\n\nHonestly, I am beyond pissed about it. Half the world is on lockdown and here we are with half of NW KS packed into one town. Its asinine. I give it a week or two before ellis county is swamped with COVID cases. \n\nThis was an GIANT fail on the part of ellis county to even ALLOW this to happen. \n\nThe governor mandated gatherings of 10 or more people be banned, yet there were easily over two thousand people "dragging main" tonight.'

b"Okay. I have a stupid question.\n\nWe own a business(Liquor store), and that requires face-face interaction at close distances for checkout. We're able to stay open, and our 2-3 employees have quit and we're being totally open with them that they're welcome back after and we'll take them for sure.  In the meantime...\n\nWould it be a stupid idea to build a little acrylic cover between the counter with a cutout for taking money/bags/handing items over? Most of our customers are doing tapless/credit and the terminal is on the other side. This would only add a bit of protection for anyone accidentally cough/spit/breath/etc since we'll be way less than 6ft away. \n\nThink of a bank basically, how there's a cutout where you push through your cash/card/etc . It would be open on the top, but we have acrylic sheets that would cover people from basically the waist up for 4-5feet.\n\nEdit: Looks like it's being the normal and seems like it'll help, even if it does a little bit. :) Thanks everyone! :)"

b'George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recent answer to this question:\n\n**Q: What mistakes are other countries making?** \n\n**A:** The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my  opinion, is that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted  by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important  role\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always  droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or  presymptomatic infections.

b"For those who havn't seen it, here is US healthcare capacity projections by state:  [https://covid19.healthdata.org/](https://covid19.healthdata.org/)"
b'**March 27**\n\nAnother mad news day. In the UK the Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Prime Minister are now all isolating with symptoms. Hancock and Johnson have both tested positive. This comes as we have the largest daily spike in deaths recorded so far; 181 today, raising the total to 759, it appears we\xe2\x80\x99re now at the point in which hundreds will be dying daily. This comes as the government announce that they will be mass testing frontline health staff, starting over the weekend but mainly beginning next week. The testing is of course vital, but time is precious and the delay could be fatal for many considering the speed at which the virus is spreading and the apparent widespread and diverse nature of who it is infecting.\n\nIn the US the stimulus package has been signed into law whilst Trump has publicly attacked, in his idiosyncratic twitter-laden way, General Motors for failing to meet the requirements needed in developing the ventilators urgently needed. Indeed as of writing it has been announced that Trump has invoked the Defence Production act, which allows the federal government to largely take charge of economic production during times of crisis, to address these challenges. Massive economic intervention from Republicans and large wellfare relief from UK Conservatives are showing just how unprecedented these times are.\n\nIn Italy it was today announced that 919 people have died of coronavirus within the last 24 hours, having lingered around the 6-7 hundred mark for the past few days I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped we\xe2\x80\x99d begin to start to see the beginning of a decline however those hopes appear naive now. To put the numbers into perspective regarding the scale of the current European epidemic, the worst documented day for deaths that China had saw 150 deaths. Images are flooding the internet and the media, warehouses full of coffins, the dead being moved by industrial machinery operated by people in specialist equipment, army convoys carrying hundreds off to be cremated. The sort of imagery of mass death the vast majority of mainland Europeans have no living memory of, scenes we thought had been left in history books or places far off that only exist on our TV screens and in situations\xc2\xa0most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t bother looking into, partly out of hopeless optimism but largely down to the ignorance our culture of detached relative luxury has for fully comprehending humanitarian crises.\n\nLogarithmically, the crisis in Spain continues at a rate which will see it surpass that of Italy (as does the US according to latest cases figures). 769 were announced dead today however Spanish health chiefs are claiming, in terms of the infection rate, that case numbers are \xe2\x80\x98stabilising\xe2\x80\x99. Whether these claims are cause for optimism or a statistical manipulation aimed at promoting calm remains to be seen and is beyond the knowledge of most to be able to provide meaningful analysis. One thing that sticks out for a layman like myself is the disparity between how severe the crisis is hitting state by state, Germany for instance is recording death rates startingly lower than that of the other majorly effected countries. A lot of analysis suggests, confirming the WHO\xe2\x80\x99s testing recommendation, that this is mainly down to the country\xe2\x80\x99s policy of rigorous testing\xc2\xa0to all sections of the population. As heroic as the work being done by those in healthcare is, the ultimate key to fighting covid-19 lies in detecting it as early as possible and limiting the infected\xe2\x80\x99s interactions\xc2\xa0as much as possible. A lot of powerful (and indeed civillian) people should be held accountable for whether they adhere or fail to follow the expert recommendations now proving to be vital to saving lives.\n\n\xc2\xa0Most African nations now have documented cases, raising the concerns I mentioned yesterday as to how equipped they will be to handle the crisis. South Africa have instilled tough measures to enforce lockdown in the early days of the spread, but being one of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s more economically prosperous nations they may not prove a good model when projecting how the pandemic will spread on the rest of the continent. The figures from the most war and poverty stricken African nations, once the spread begins to hit, could very well prove catastrophic.\n\nThe takeaway from the day though is that for Europe, the figures are continuing to rise and for Britain we are days away from losing hundreds daily, largely on par with Italy and Spain.\n\nUk Cases stand at 13,649 Deaths stand at 759\n\nWorldwide cases stand at 590,506, Deaths stand at 26,952'
b'My 94yo grandma sadly passed away in a nursing home today- shed had a stroke a couple years ago and was non verbal and highly dependent, though still alert. While not from coronavirus, all visitors were banned a couple of weeks ago to prevent the spread and this probably hit her hard, since her daughter (my aunt) and her husband visit her twice a day and were the only ones to get her to eat. Apparently she stopped eating and fell into a coma a few days ago, just passing today.\n\nIt may well have been her time anyway, and she lived a long time, but what kills me is that she probably thought family had abandoned her and lost the will to live :(  Can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel that she is an indirect victim of covid-19c in this way.'

I'm unemployed now and barely leave the house, I wash my hands constantly, practice social distancing, and I see where his logic is coming from, but washing your clothes every time you go somewhere seems a bit much?"
b"Four days ago I realised I couldn't taste or smell anything. It was very weird and very sudden. Then yesterday I began having sharp stomach pain, diarrhoea, and headaches. I called my GP and they said none of those is a coronavirus symptom. Then I read online that all of them are. \n\nSo I called my GP again and they said to take my temperature but I don't have a thermometer. I told them I would go get one and they said not to leave my house or go to A&E so then I asked how am I supposed to know my temperature if I don't have a thermometer? All my family are in another part of the world. I do have a weird kind of pressure in my lungs but it's not too bad and I'm not coughing so I think its from the CPAP I use. I'm trying to stay positive because it's very likely something other than coronavirus. But it's weird because I get the impression that my GP office doesn't really understand what they're telling people and that's kinda scary in itself..."

b"My chest has felt tight for 12 days, the first week during that time I felt fevery, but not sweaty, although I don't have a thermometer.

Other than that, no flu symptoms other than a runny nose and feeling utterly exhausted each morning. Fortunately,  have self isolated as a precaution. The chest feeling was better a couple days ago, but today feels back to where it was (not worse though)... I'm in Montana.\nI'm worried about the upcoming spring allergies.

b"My cousin works at a hospital in NYC and I'm almost done asking her how things are going. It gets worse every time I do. The latest was that they were talking about not even bothering to ventilate patients over 70 because they don't usually make it. She said she personally hasn't seen any elderly person getting off of one once they have to go on it so it makes sense to save it for younger people who have a chance. Terrifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Though I should add that many of them do not need one - but the ones that do are in such terrible shape with their organs failing and they are simply unable to recover)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a more positive note: one of my good friends had COVID. She's pregnant and smoked a lot before she became pregnant, so she wasn't the healthiest individual. She ended up in the hospital this past week needing oxygen but is now home and feeling much better. My mom likely had it as well - had all the symptoms and had recently traveled with several coworkers who fell ill, one of whom tested positive- and she is recovered without needing a hospital. So, there's two bits of good anecdotes to combat that one really grim one."
b'You guys, the Walmart had the stuff I needed in stock, and I almost cried!'
b' The global response to COVID-19 has varied considerably from country to country, which has facilitated spread of the virus. Thousands are dead, millions are out of work, and the worst is probably yet to come. There has been little to no effective global leadership from any individual or organization. The UN Security Council is deadlocked while they squabble over blame. In this particular situation, there should have been legal standards for pandemic response that every country should have followed; instead, the crisis spiraled out of control. This can never be allowed to happen again; the age of quarrelling, disorganized nation-states must come to an end.\n\nTherefore, humanity needs a \xe2\x80\x9crevamped\xe2\x80\x9d version of the United Nations, which provides a centralized federal government for the entire world that all countries will follow.

b"My psychiatrist just mass texted all patients that her office is closed until further notice and she won't be filling any scripts. Told everyone to call their PCP to see if they will write refills. Yeah. I'm sure my absolutely swamped primary care doc will be happy to write me scripts on my various psych medications (one of which is a controlled substance).

I was so excited to graduate and to make decent money in a job I love. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m broke and entering an economic depression during a pandemic. I was driving for Uber while in school, but that has obviously disappeared as an option. I know I can get unemployment potentially now but I\xe2\x80\x99m just sad, anxious, and afraid for our future, not just work wise but for the mass amounts of loss of life expected and that has already happened. I am just devastated at the current state of everything, I find it hard not to cry. I was wondering if anyone was in the same position and to check in to see how they were feeling. Stay safe."
b"Sheit i just realized my dad used to be a smoker and now I'm even more worried. He quit like 25 years ago; but I'm not sure how heavy of a smoker he was back then.

b"I have to be honest here, I'm kind of afraid to go back to work. I've had a week off that I had taken for a vacation I was previously going to take but canceled but took the time off anyway. I'm supposed to go back to work on Monday. I'm 24 but have severe hypertension so I know it wouldn't be good if I caught it. To top things off I work at a pharmacy in the US so I have people that are coming in with all sorts of symptoms constantly that I have to interact with. I'm not really sure what to do though. It's easy to think that I should just stop going in but I need my job and despite being a member of management that doesn't secure my job or anything."

b"Hoping for someone to give me some clarity.\n\nItaly's numbers are hugely concerning to us all, but the biggest thing that worries me is the constant new cases.\n\nMy question for the informed is this. Why is this not slowing down despite lockdown measures? I know it could be worse, but is this still spreading because people are popping out shopping and picking it up to \nbring it home? Flouting quarantine? \n\nOr my biggest fear as a UK citizen, that all these people have had it all along and they are slowly being discovered post a long incubation period?\n\nI havent left the house at all in 9 days and concerned I could just wake up tomorrow coughing all the same."

b'Just contacted a (UK) friend staying in coastal India, and they said, \n\n"Things are pretty bad here. The lockdown is being enforced by violence. I\'ve seen many beatings here in the last few days. Food shops are supposed to be open but 90% are not. Medicine and food deliveries are being stopped by the police. Ground wells are beginning to run dry and water is not being delivered. Your average Indian considers this a European virus so we are experiencing prejudice and sometimes we are being denied access to food shops. No accomodation is being given India wide and many foreigners including British families are homeless. The British Embassy are basically saying they can do nothing and repatriation flights are not being considered. We have complete travel ban so getting to an airport is impossible and all internal and international flights are suspended until mid April. We expect this to be extended. And this is just in my area which is very laid back with foreigners. Those in the majority of India are getting it rough. Only the German government is helping EU nationals. They are working hard on repatriation flights but have only managed New Delhi so far. The logistics of getting EU nationals to airports for possible flights is beyond complex and may be virtually impossible. Once the number of deaths here starts spiralling we will no longer be safe in India due to the hostility and violence. Currently we are considered plague infested. " \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to find out if there is anything else that the Embassy could/should be doing?  (If the Germans are able to do it, why can\'t we?)\n\nDoes anyone have any other sensible advice I can give my friend?'

She works for a big-box home good supply store which is deemed "essential" and is open. It is also unfortunately JAMMED packed every day. She has been off for two weeks paid because of her circumstance. That ends on the 30th. Anyone know what her options are with the stimulus bill?

b'I\'m an administrator for a small boys group home in southern California. We have about 32 boys in mid to late teenage years, all of whom are on probation. All are from varying counties, some as far as Contracosta. We can\'t close down, as the boys live there.\n\nCurrently, about half of the youth are going out for weekend home passes with their families and then coming back to us. I\'m positive that the virus is very likely already spreading at my facility unseen. We have about a half of a bottle of hand sanitizer, a half of a tube of Clorox wipes, no face masks and only one large box of gloves. Our thermometers are cheap Walmart brand and they all give wildly different readings. I\'m terrified. If the youth fall ill, we have to care for them until they need to go to the hospital. My position is also an acting med tech, so it will fall on me to administer medication, and monitor sick youth. The facility is non profit so I only make 17.50 an hour. It\'s not a matter of "if" it\'s a matter of "when" it\'s going to hit facilities like mine and it\'s going to suck. The staff and youth live / work in close quarters, and none of the probation departments will cease sending the youth home for the weekend.\n\nJust keep social workers like us in your thoughts. We have zero PPE and nowhere to get more.'
b"Can we talk about the official numbers being reported. Italy has just had 919 deaths in a single day.

This has been going on for over 2 weeks now and he is worried every night he works. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm more than happy to buy them and pay for shipping because these front line guys need safe equipment."

b"My mother recently went to her Primary Care physician with a common cold (suburban town outside capitol).

The way my mom described it seemed to match up with the Covid-19 test (long swab, up the nose etc). \n\nBut the doctor said the results would be ready in 20minutes? And my mother was told she tested negative with 20minutes of the test. Given some antibiotics for the cold/cough. And left. \n\nAs far as I know the coronavirus testing takes a couple days. And I've heard the new rapid version still takes about 45minutes which Is double the time it took not to mention how scarcely available these tests are at the moment. \n\nIs it possible this was not an actual test?

Reddit) and news (other than a daily update) too, if not entirely. \n\nThe internet and 24 hour news were already a gateway to poor mental health and this period of time is making that effect so much more pronounced.

b"I have a question that I'm surprised to see hasn't been brought up yet. Isn't the sample of people who've been tested inherently skewed to show lower percentage of positives than the general population because of the testing criteria?\n\nTo elaborate: the only control studies we have are from Iceland, Princess Cruise Ship, Wuhan expats, and Vo (town in Italy where they tested all 3,000 inhabitants) and they all seem to show that between to 20-50% of cases could be asymptomatic. That would suggest that the virus is far more widespread than we realize. \n\nThat doesn't square with the fact that positive test numbers (even in hard hit areas with strict testing criteria i.e. need extreme symptoms) seem to come in at only about 5-25% positive. BUT I've read that someone with the flu or other sickness is highly unlikely to contract the virus, since their immune systems are already working overtime, giving the coronavirus little chance to spread. \n\nThat could mean that anyone with some non corona virus illness would actually be less likely to test positive than an asympotmatic person chosen randomly off the street.. Has there been any research into this? I'm far from an expert, just hoping someone can point me towards relevant studies."

Like even if you have tested for your allergens its pretty damn likely that you might have an allergy to Ibuprofen without knowing it. People who have no idea they have allergies are likely allergic to it. I'm not saying everyone is allergic to it, but I remember a statistic that like 8/10 people with allergies also have a violent reaction to it.

b'When should we reasonably expect to get this money?'
b"I NEED to take this advice more seriously. It's like an addiction at this point."
b'I honestly think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fear mongering going on here. Everyone should take this virus very seriously but bear in mind that for the vast majority of people suffer from mild symptoms.\nSelf isolate, do not visit friends or family, stay away from the elderly and ill.\nTry not to think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to die from it if you\xe2\x80\x99re young and healthy because you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not going to experience severe symptoms.'
b"I feel like this represents a chance at a reset of the way we do things, the way you lead your life and the choices you make. I'm feeling quite optimistic TBH.

I ride the bike trainer in the basement each morning before I start work, and my kids and I play cards many nights.\n\nIt has been a wake up call for me to keep plugging away.\n\nEven as a middle aged male there is a 99.6% chance I will be here in a year, at least.

If he is imminently going to die (i.e., in minutes to hours), they will usually allow a very brief family visit (around 15-20min). You should ask your mom what the ICU policy is. \n\n3) How far are you from him and how would you travel? You need to evaluate the risk of travel.\n\nSorry that none of that is positive.

b"I think in some of the more rural areas the shelter in place laws will ease up.  I grew up in a small town and most places didn't have more than 10 people in a store and kept their distance in general.  Once we start to have more test kits and treatment centers in place, i'm sure we'll see more restrictions lifted.  But keep in mind that doesn't make us less contagious, just more able to handle people when they are sick.  Still we shouldn't be shaking hands/hugging or gathering in large groups as a general social etiquette rule."

They're also not thinking about the speed that this virus hits.\n\nI know people who think it's extremely important to appear busy. Fear of looking 'lazy' for staying at home motivates them more than fear of what the virus can do to themselves or their community. It's tragic."
b'I think that it is hard for people to grasp, especially in our current ego-centric society, that WE are the problem. Just look at the videos of people playing basketball in New York City like nothing is happening around them. Or the companies forcing people to come to work despite all that\xe2\x80\x99s happened. Unless we have a radical paradigm shift that suddenly causes us to care about other\xe2\x80\x99s well being, this ego-centric lifestyle will be what causes more and more illness.

b'This seems to be entirely dependent on the individual.

It took a week and a half from that point then one weekend about 8 days out she felt better and was fine the next day. That was about a week and a half to that point. I\xe2\x80\x99d say the whole thing lasted 3 1/2 weeks. She had random chills and occasional fevers throughout was mostly only achy the first week or so.\n\nIf I had it which I may have, I felt mostly a cold, a tad short of breath during more moderate/heavier activity, had a fever for only an evening, was a little fatigued for like 2 weeks but that was about it. All my symptoms were spaced out. My biggest gripe was the way my throat was irritated, and phlegm in the upper throat, I ate a lot of hot sauce to clear it out and drank hot beverages all day long. All my other symptoms were entirely independent, it was like having a cold or flu where each symptom was a day or two and completely independent of one another.\n\nIf it\xe2\x80\x99s anything like my wife\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99ll start to feel better over the next few days then it\xe2\x80\x99s just gone.'

b'Our hospital has moved L&D to the outpatient surgery center, same campus but separate building.  Elective cases have been postponed so the space was available.

b'It is possible, but there are a few major differences between Western countries and China. Their rate of traveling, especially people that do not live in the richer cities, is much lower than ours.\n\nThey were able to issue total lockdown, not allowing people to go out of their houses.\n\nThe population is much more disciplined and when the central government issues and order, they do it. \n\nWith the size of their army, they could send thousands of military medical staff to the heavily hit locations. \n\nAlso centralized government with so much power is able to move millions of people and thousands of factories with a single order. Our systems are not as flexible in case of emergency.'

b'Close to half of people with it don\xe2\x80\x99t show symptoms at all.

b"You shouldn't be on reddit or other social media in your state of mind. Make up rules for yourself to consciously stay informed without panicking.

Then, switch off your mobile devices, read, exercise, binge watch, spend conciousnquality time with your kid, make face time dates  and do other stuff.

b'Oh, man, I feel your pain! I\'m sorry :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was me two weekends ago, working in a bookstore in Southern California. Confirmed cases in surrounding towns/cities north/south/east of us and everyone in the tri-county area seemed to come in looking for books and puzzles to have for sheltering in place. We had our busiest weekend of the year outside of the one just pre-Christmas! And multiple people commented weirdly about my wearing gloves, even! Also was told that "it\'s not here yet, don\'t worry" as if, I dunno, you magically turn green like a Sim when you get sick and we\'d all know about it. And, yknow, it didn\'t have a super long undetectable incubation period and wasn\'t highly highly contagious as evidenced by it popping up all the fuck over the planet. People with snotty kids? Of course! People with coughs? Oh totally! One older woman ignoring the shelter in place for over 65\'s directive laughed about being "part of the problem." \n\nI went home from work that day to a news update confirming the first case in town. Only time in my life I haven\'t loved being proved right. I hope you\'re well, and I\'m sorry you have to be in a position to choose between money and health.'
b'That would be incredibly smart. Hurry up and do it.'
b'Have to agree with previous reply. Anything to deter droplets from getting to you.'
b'That is actually a fairly good idea. In some countries, for example mine, this started happening across many businesses. Some places also refuse cash now, allowing only card payments to reduce contact. Pharmacies across the country are adding plastic screens to protect the workers.'

b">hence why the southern states aren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing big numbers yet\n\nPretty sure the reason they aren't seeing high numbers is a lack of testing sadly"
b">Let\xe2\x80\x99s say there is some truth to the warm weather affecting the spread, hence why the southern states aren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing big numbers yet. What happens come October and November? Are we looking at a second round of a Covid outbreak in tangent with the flu season?\n\nWhat about New Orleans, what about Florida? Both of those areas are experiencing significant growth in hospitalizations. They're just being overshadowed by what's going on in New York."
b"That doesn't sound severe or specific enough to get you tested in most places sadly."
b"One of the things to note is that getting tested doesn't really benefit you. There's no treatment besides the symptoms, so unless you're sick enough to get hospitalized your best bet is to avoid infecting other people and rest up. Keep an eye on your temp and your breathing and if you do need to go in go to an emergency room. Call them first though."

b"Yes it should stay closed longer, the CDC recommends no gatherings of more than 50 people, and some sources say no more than 10. Plus in most cities all bars, restaurants, gyms and stuff like that are closed. I wouldn't be surprised if the school moves this date further into the future.

b"Yes, there is no concern about COVID-19 being spread by food. In order to get COVID-19, you really need to inhale droplets into your respiratory system. COVID-19 will be killed in the cooking process of most foods. If any COVID-19 remains, when you swallow food your throat closes off your respiratory system so that you don't get food in your lungs."

b"No. A lot of people will get sick and a lot of people will die, but, it's not likely that any one single person will die, assuming you aren't already in poor health.\n\nMost people will be just fine."
b'Another thing is that population of each country is different. Switzerland with 13 000 of cases but 8.7 mil population is far far worse off than US with 100 000 cases and pop of 330 mil. \n\nThe same goes for the amount of tests. Small country doing 10 000 tests per day  could have the same per capita number of tests as US with 500 000 tests per day.'
b'Edible Arrangements. They know why.'
b'Not all deaths from flu get reported as such, but conservative estimates seem to be somewhere around 20 000 people per year, mostly thanks to large number of old people. Coronavirus so far is close to 10 000 in Italy and it is far from over... let alone it is often killing age groups that would not die from flu, just because of how swarmed the hospitals are over there.'
b'Still have liquor and internet. Will endure.'
b'This way healthcare workers can\xe2\x80\x99t complain about the disgusting lack of PPE to their administrators because they are just \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing CDC guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s criminal.'
b'He should be okay. The lungs recover dramatically with time. There was actually a recent article about it.'
b"Yup\nThe gastro symptoms are new. Headache fever and fatigue seem to be the common symptoms everyone has. Be glad that shit didn't get to your lungs! \nWhat sucks is everyone is so depleted you need like 4 or 5 symptoms with an active fever to get treatment. \nStay safe and healthy!

b'> Is there a general consensus that the number of reported Chinese deaths is bullshit? If Italy is anything to go by, Chinese deaths are surely in the 10s of thousands?\n\nThere is general consensus that the Chinese numbers are made up, yes. That said, they were VERY aggressive about lockdowns. They literally welded people into their homes. These measures, while extreme, certainly helped curtail the outbreak.\n\nIt also makes sense that the outbreak would be worse in Western nations with actual civil liberties.'
b'Wearing a mask outside very much does help. This is for instance one of the cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention efforts in the Czech Republic that appears to have helped them to one of the lowest infection rates in Europe.\n\nI believe the "don\'t wear masks outside" was an attempt to keep more masks available to medical professionals. We have a catastrophic shortage of those as it is, and society benefits a lot more from a doctor with a mask than a single individual with a mask.\n\nThere are plenty of resources out there on how to make your own mask at home. Make one, wear one, you WILL save a life, not necessarily your own.'
b"1) A simple cloth mask is not as good as an N95 mask. \n\n2) Both help reduce your risk of spreading the virus if you have it and also help to filter out infected droplets from other people so keep you from getting it. \n\n2) There are not enough masks for the doctors and nurses right now. They are at highest risk, since they are dealing with COVID patients (sometimes inches away from them) all day. So if people hoard masks, the highest risk people can't get them. \n\nIf there were enough N95 masks for everyone, everyone should wear a mask. \n\nSince there are not, it is best for society to prioritize the people who are at highest risk and who can do the most to fight the virus (i.e., healthcare workers)."
b"The WHO says masks don't help healthy people avoid viruses. This is the basic paper masks because the paper fibres have gaps that don't stop the virus getting through and walking outside you are not going to be close enough  to get the virus on you from others anyway. Doctors are generally wearing better masks and they need them because they are closer to infected people. Even if you did wear masks with proper filters, there are strict procedures for removing otherwise you are just touching your face with hands again. Even doctors and nurses in full gear got ebola because they made mistakes in removal.  I've seen photos of people wearing masks with ungloved hands on public transport, or taking the mask on and off as they walk, so touching their faces which all a bit pointless and a placebo in my opinion but also supported by the WHO."

b"There is a suspicion that the severity of initial exposure has an effect on overall how severe a case you have.

b'Yes makes a huge difference, if you are inundated with large amounts of the virus your bodies immune system has a harder time fighting the virus thus you\xe2\x80\x99ll get much more sick'

b"It's a bonus. Tax credits come out at the very end of the tax return. After you calculate income, take deductions, and calculate tax, only then are tax credits used to reduce tax further."
b"Think of it kind of like an IRS gift card. You owe let's say $10k total taxes this year once you go through all the math, but you got a $1200 gift card so you only gotta pay $8.8k out of pocket. Effectively it just increases your refund (or reduces what you have to pay if you were short)."
b"I think you might be confusing tax credits with tax deductions. This money is not income. It can't in any way increase your taxes.\n\nSo basically, everyone that qualifies is getting a 1,200 credit for 2020. These checks are just giving it to us early.\n\nTax credits are amounts that come out of tax at the very end of the tax return. So you have income minus deductions, then you calculate your tax. Only after you calculate your tax, you take tax credits to get to the final amount. \n\nIf you already have some kind of tax credit, it doesn't matter. This will decrease your tax by 1,200 regardless of anything else (assuming you qualify)."

Scrolling through news and amassing "data" is the closest thing we can feel to being on top of the virus, which we also logically know is impossible, beyond social distancing.

b"I genuinely don't really give a fuck about most people and mild symptoms. This has zero impact on my anxiety. I don't think this is why most people are anxious.\n\nMost people are anxious because of how it can overwhelm the health care system.\n\nBecause once a health care system is overwhelmed then suddenly treatable illnesses become more deadly.

Whether it\'s learning a new language or investigating your family tree, bonding with your kids or other family members, or fixing that chair. Very few times in history have people been given such an opportunity where they have ample amounts of time to do something.

I also recall seeing a recent estimate from somewhere in Europe as low as 1%, and another around 8%.\n\nI think the 50% figure was based on a sample of an Italian town where everyone was tested, but I'm not sure if they monitored the asymptomatic patients longitudinally to see if they ever developed symptoms, and I'm also not sure about the specificity of the test they used.\n\nAnd then there are also estimates given for the percentage of infected people who are either asymptomatic or presymptomatic, and for the percent of infected people who are not showing symptoms at any given time. Edit: And also for the percent of infected people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic."
b"3 weeks is actually much longer than I would expect the hospitals to last for, especially in the heavily affected areas. Isn't NY already running at capacity now?"

b'Thanks for clarifying for me!'
b'All of social media and, these days, the internet at large, is complete anathema to a healthy mind.'
b'Rationing is the one everyone is afraid to talk about. Someone has to decide "Do I take the 52 y.o. father of three and grandfather of one off the ventilator and give it to the 14 y.o. boy who just showed up in ICU?"\n\n"I\'m glad it\'s not me." is what most of us are saying, but people will be making these decisions for us in the coming weeks--and some of those doctors will never recover from making those choices.'
b'Everyone is concerned, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a father who\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the end of his life riddled with cancer. I can\xe2\x80\x99t spend the time I want to spend with him and will probably never hug him every again or spend an hour in his company. I\xe2\x80\x98be got a mother and step father who are in the at risk category, a girlfriend who\xe2\x80\x99s a nurse and pregnant. Everyone has anxiety about this. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that most people experience mild symptoms and don\xe2\x80\x99t need hospitalisation.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not concerning, it would be naive to treat it like it\xe2\x80\x99s a cold because it\xe2\x80\x99s not, but again, most people do not need treatment.\nStay say and I wish you nothing but good health.'
b'Agreed. What gives me anxiety is how horribly we are handling the crisis in the U.S. - I am one of the lucky ones who can work remotely (I am a professor at a small university). But I am worried about how this will all systemically effect people. My students who are working two jobs and have kids, and now have no income stream. Students who will not take their online classes seriously and will drop out, changing the course of their lives for the next decade. Families being evicted. Incomes drying up. \n\nAnd eventually, you know, even though I am prepared for my family with an emergency fund and a good, healthy financial position, this still can disrupt everything I\'ve built up. Will new students be returning to get college degrees at the same rate, or will we see universities shutting their doors? I am not tenured, yet, so if there are program cuts, or trimming of budgets, I am vulnerable. In fact tenure would not matter at all if a university just closes up and the states don\'t have the funds to bail it out. And like dominoes, we can see many of our highly leveraged and interconnected industries collapse. And so on and so on. \n\nUsually the solution to collapses like these tend to come in the form of highly centralized, authoritarian regimes who need to come in and force everything back up and running. Once the economy gets running again, back off to war. And so on and so on. \n\nI don\'t know. I understand what I can and cannot control, but there is still a serious threat to these (sometimes quite flimsy systems) of banking, industry, healthcare, democracy, transportation, manufacturing, education. Everything that sustains how we normally live is shifting. Which can have positive outcomes! But I think there will be quite a bit of suffering to get to this "new normal" that people are talking about, and we need to be prepared for that.'
b'This and the fact that hospitals WILL start making decisions on who lives and who dies the second they\xe2\x80\x99re overwhelmed. Can you imagine your mom, dad, brother, sister, son, daughter have Covid-19 and are at the hospital dying, not being able to breath, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be there to hold their hand, you can\xe2\x80\x99t comfort them, no one can. Then on top of that, you are told that the Dr at the hospital said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to let your relative die because there are other people who are in the ER that have a better chance of living.\n\nThis alone has broken me within the last 24 hours.'
b'This is a very hard decision to make, with no "right" answer. Your father is in very dire medical condition. You should mentally prepare yourself for bad news, even while hoping for the best outcome. Even if you were to travel there, you would most likely not be able to see him (again, ask someone there what the ICU visitor policy is right now).\n\nCase fatality rate of patients admitted to the ICU is quite high, ranging from 20-50% depending on the data you look at. So at best, this is a game of Russian Roulette with a 5 chamber revolver. At worst, it\'s a coin flip. So sorry you\'re going through this.'

Humble idiot living in Tokyo here.\n\nI have shared my thoughts on the sub a few times on the events happening in Tokyo, especially with the current "soft lockdown" and how the public appears to be responding to it (looks like the majority will still go outside, from a survey on Thursday...).\n\nI just want to share that I have just submitted my application, and though I am not sure how much I am able to help I am interested in contributing what I know and can observe here at a greater capacity.\n\nThanks for your time.'
b'I am your guy for the job. My uni is closed till july. No online classes. I have have more than enough time to do the job diligently. I also know some programming and data analytics.'

b'Belgium here. Just making a post so I can hit the 15 postmark and apply. Lurk here 15 hours a day so i can help :)'
b'Look for the people who are trying to help other people, and not let this get worse then it is. That would entail stopping the spread of misinformation (fact checking), and also keeping information to scientific evidence/facts. Can all be done with searches through most university library databases and the internet. Gotta also be sure that posts that were once posted as plausibly factual, that then got proven to be illegitimate information (Yes I\xe2\x80\x99m pointing at you BBC), are removed promptly.'
b"Hey...folks consider mw too.I have a lot of free time.(watching movies is now getting bored..).I really wanna contribute more...consider me thanks..Because of this sub's presence of knowledge I was able to call some of my friends back to their home before lockdown and also I am closely monitoring situation since first week of jan on r/worldnews. I am also good contributor . My one post was trending on r/all at number 1.(it was news related). I am more than happy to help you guys..."
b"Stupid reddit algorithm calling my previous account suspicious. Actually, I made the account when emails weren't required and didn't bother to update it later, so that's technically my fault. After just quitting my 3 year job as an ER scribe in Portland, Oregon to return to school in May (in Mississippi, so we'll see how that goes) my month to travel and see friends is pretty empty, but I think your criteria are reasonable, since theres no good way to get people outside of reddit unless they're a verified public figure on the subject. I hope you find the right people going forward."

b'Yikes, I only have 4000 karma :( \n\nBeen lurking on reddit for over 5 years xD'
b'Make it in more languages.'
b"Not applying for this but just some observations and feedback. \n\nSub in Early to mid March was at its peak growth phase and saw massive rise in new Moderators as well. I think the sub was best at that time when accounting for Scale (relevant since it may very well be even better in Jan-Feb but Scale is critical in this context, a 100K sub ain't like a Million+ one). \n\nIn the last 10 days or so due to the sheer volume of users coming here is running against basic subreddit scale related dynamics which unfortunately are created by Reddit Admins by giving Mod-teams toolkits which are antiquated and ones which were made for Reddit of pre 2015. Almost every mod of any decent sized sub knows about this issue.  \n\nUse the increase in mod numbers to align it to a benchmark phase of early march, whatever that spectrum is in your understanding. This sub doesn't need to be as technical as rCOVD19 or as casual as rWorldnews or as racist as some others. It can still strive for a balance of say informing who comes here and leaving at least better off than they arrived at (in terms of being aware/knowledgeable). Discussion can happen in addition to that as a secondary aspect."
b'I can help'
b'Are Republicans welcome ?'
b'Viruses are always looking for new hosts, even moderators. Lol'
b"Honestly without serious filtering/interviewing you are just gonna end up hiring a bunch of Chinese shills deleting posts or comments that are bad for China's image. The bias in this sub is already pretty bad especially in the comments section.\n\nNot saying Chinese shills are not allowed to be mods but a lot of people rely on this subreddit to be their sole source of pandemic news. Information bias caused by the Chinese shills could end up having very bad consequences."
b'How lovely might it be if someone with firsthand knowledge of the pandemic and no knowledge of Reddit were to be in this position? May make for a great sub where the good stuff can always get through and the bs is eliminated\xe2\x80\x94based on science and medicine and nothing else.'
b'Has there been new openings as of late? \n\n& of course because this is reddit it be should be automatically assumed that a certain idealogical line must be towed. Things like referring to this thing as the Chinese Virus would be unacceptable because it\'s horribly RACIST. A virus some would contend is worse than the Wu-Flu itself. Oh, can you say Wu-Flu? I don\'t want to be acting all racial.\n\nIs advising the purchase of guns and ammunition racist as well? Again, we don\'t want to be spreading "anti-asian sentiment". \n\nIt\'s important to be clear what the rules of this subbreddit are. The last thing we would want is the spread of an even more deadly virus: racism.\n\nSome of the earliest warners of this pandemic have now been completely shadow banned or just outright deleted on twitter and other social media platforms. People, who have literally saved lives that because they told some "insensitive jokes" about a certain demographic where this covid19 originated have now been punished for their wrong think. People who had they not been sounding off their alarms back in mid January we would have an even higher death toll, and who been actually LISTENED to back when all this was much more preventable could have saved God knows how many at this point because this virus isn\'t stopping any time soon. I wonder why this hasn\'t been a bigger deal in countries like Japan and Russia? They must REALLY be focused on not being racist unlike us. I want to be clear because the last thing we want is the most important spread of that which we must contain- and that\'s racism.\n\nThis nightmare that\'s gonna be fucking seasonal is likely going to be part of everyday life now. But the important thing, is that we shouted from the highest rooftops that we weren\'t bigots when time mattered.'

b'I really hope this works for them but I really don\'t see Instacart doing anything except cancelling all of their accounts and signing up a new crop of desperate people since anyone can get the "job" in 5 minutes. I hope I am wrong.'
b"In Canada some cities have Twitter and Facebook pages for #caremongering which is a network of volunteers that will pickup your groceries and household items for you. It's been spreading so if you can no longer use Instacart but also can't leave the house check out if there is a group in your area!"
b"I mean good for them. I get it I really do. Just sucks for me.\n\nEdit: I got asthma. This virus will kill me. Instacart had been my life savior. I fully support what they're doing I'm just lamenting about my own position. The two are not mutually exclusive."
b'I really hope something comes of this. \nMy mother died in an accident Sunday on her way home from an instacart order. \nInstacart needs to be doing the most for their people right now.'
b"Good for them! They are a vital service in this time of crisis. I too am an at risk person, but has yet to utilize their services or others like that. I would not want to risk my life, let alone without worthwhile compensation and benefits. I have been doing my own shopping as little as possible, wearing a homemade mask. I don't like it, but I also don't want to participate in any services that aren't valuing the lives, safety and well being of it's workers. We're all in this together! They have my full support."
b'[deleted]'
b"Time to start Schwan's back up."
b'I used instacart for the first time as we sheltered in with our baby. I felt guilty putting someone else in danger to do our shopping, so I tipped her 25% of the bill.'
b'I felt so bad for my Instacart shopper this week (first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tried a grocery delivery service) that I had my husband tip her (in addition to my cash tip) a bottle of sanitizer and an 18 pack of TP. (I don\xe2\x80\x99t hoard, I\xe2\x80\x99m just bad at estimating my Amazon subscribe and save subscriptions and happened to already have 2 full cases of TP in my garage long before the Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020)'
b'I started using instacart the last couple weeks because of covid. I\'ve been giving generous "hazard pay" tips for the workers. They\'re providing an essential service to the community and I hope that Instacart can accommodate their demands to keep them safe.'
b'Brilliant. \n\nThis is something that should of happened months back even before the virus for all gig workers.  For example, its not unusual seeing a Ubereats/Doordash or Grubhub payout for $3-$5 when your driving 6-8+ miles one way, navigating through an apartment complex or walking up flights of stairs.  I am in great shape, this has nothing to do with being healthy or not.  Its more about how no one should be driving their own car, paying their own expenses but only making a few bucks to do X amount of work.  Its pathetic.'
b"This may kill Instacart.  I'm guessing they don't have enough operating capital to replace their driver fleet in time. Company isn't profitable yet.  They will burn through that $1b pretty fast.\n\nOn the other hand, times are weird.  Their usage is probably skyrocketing.  Which means they might have to agree to the terms.\n\nWhich means Uber and Lyft might be forced to do something to protect their drivers.  Would be a good outcome."
b'More work places need to unionize'
b"It's gratifying to see workers using their collective power to try and earn a fair wage and benefits. Apparently Whole Foods workers are planning something similar. I wonder if Covid 19 will mark a seismic shift in labor in America."
b'So basically instacart is going out of business.'
b"Give them whatever the fuck they want. I completely support them. I have an order scheduled for that day, and there are several items in it that will hurt to do without. I'm disabled, and frankly terrified to leave the house, and even without the damned virus, I'm not usually able to do my own shopping. I rely on delivery.\n\nBut I will gladly do without to support these people. They deserve whatever they want."
b'Good.'
b'Ahem, nurses are you ready?'
b'Ordered from them a week ago, delivery was supposed to be tonight (earliest time slot). The driver messages me halfway through shopping my order to tell me the store is closing and she can\xe2\x80\x99t finish. So she leaves it all! And there is a 200 minute wait time to talk to customer service. I get that they\xe2\x80\x99re overwhelmed right now but wow.'
b'Good for them.  Instacart is one of the worst abusers of the gig economy.'
b'ITT: People who were woefully undereducated about the history of the labor rights movement in this country (and their sacrifices for even the minimal protections we enjoy today).'
b'Hey I\xe2\x80\x99m all for more benefits for the Instacart gig workers, but there are some things presented as facts here that are false.\n\nInstacart is giving 14 days pay to anyone who is diagnosed with corona or put on mandatory quarantine, so if you get sick and aren\xe2\x80\x99t officially diagnosed because there\xe2\x80\x99s no test, they will still be paying you.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also until May 8th, not in April like the article states.\n\nAgain, please don\xe2\x80\x99t chew my head off, I\xe2\x80\x99m all for more pay and better benefits for their hourly workers, but this article is saying things that go directly against what Instacart is saying their policy is.'
b'Fuck the gig economy'
b"These people are already trained, they have already dealt with what's required every day, so that's good for them\nI do see their point, though.  My heart goes out to all the health workers out there but there are so many people helping us survive right now:\n\ngarbage collectors\npostal workers\ngas/electricity/water workers\nall those mean and really stupid/assholish/dumb government workers you've hated in the past who right now are working their asses off to get those cheques in the US to you\n\nSo many, many, many unsung heroes"
b'This won\xe2\x80\x99t get seen by most, but for those that do: fuck instacart. I tried that \xe2\x80\x9cjob\xe2\x80\x9d for two months and basically lost a lot of money. It was like 5 years ago but they\xe2\x80\x99d make you park in a designated parking lot and hope you get a delivery. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d sit there for 3+ hours before an order came in, and get paid like $20 for over 90 minutes of shopping and delivering. My deliveries almost never tipped whatsoever. I seriously had a shift and sat there in my car waiting for 8 hours without an order. Completely wasted my entire day and made nothing. \n\nI prolly was just unlucky but it was really weird from the get go. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a credit card, here\xe2\x80\x99s where you go, bye!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Every single Essential Employee right now needs to Unionize! It is the perfect time to do it. But please practice social distancing while doing so!'
b'This should extend to all our essential workers right now.'
b'My instacart worker replace my toilet paper request with 2 toothbrushes lol was I suppose to scrub my butt with them lol'
b'Dang I literally just signed up with the app to earn some extra cash'
b'Fuck.'
b'This is such a joke, there are people posting on the instacart subreddit making $2,000 a week and they want to strike over more pay.... We have millions living on unemployment who could easily step in and make bank.'
b'30 min later, thousands of new workers are working.'
b'Just as I was in the process of signing up'
b"Fu#@ instacart. I paid like 140 bucks for the year and I found out later that each item is marked up and my Costco card that they buy at Costco doesn't earn me points.\n\nI also just found out the drivers weren't getting ripped when the app deliberately states that 100 percent of the tips went to drivers.\n\nI also didn't know they treat their workers like shit.\n\nDouble ##ck instacart..."
b'This will force 80 year-olds with one lung back into the stores. You guys know that, right?'
b"I'm doing all my online shopping ASAP. Only a matter of time before it'll be near impossible to get deliveries. Or it'll take extra long due to shortage of workers."
b'We need more of this. If the feds and state health departments won\xe2\x80\x99t protect us we need to protect ourselves!'
b"Ah crap. I just placed an order for delivery mid next week... But now that I know how shitty the workers are being treated, I guess I'll go do my own shopping."
b"Can I say this as a PSA to any Instacart drivers - please have a PayPal or venmo or online banking set up so that we can tip you directly. I never use cash, and I'm high risk, so I've been in isolation for a month and will not risk going to the bank. I've been using the app's instant tip function, assuming that my 25%goes to the drivers. I've asked a few if I can just send them that money via tap or something, and they never have anything set up to accept a cash transfer. Please delivery people - some customers really want to tip you for your service but have no means to do so!"
b'Welp, I was considering a membership, but I guess I can just stick with the two huge chains that have delivery in my town already.'
b"Aren't they independent contractors? What is this sick leave you are describing?"
b"Unemployment with the new bill: $15 an hour for 40 hours a week PLUS whatever the state decides to give you as well for 4 months.\n\nLyft to drivers: Tired of not having any passengers? You've already passed the background check, we'll mail you a debit card and you can be an Instacart shopper!\n\nHonestly, with a guaranteed $2600 or more a month from unemployment, I don't understand why any Instacarter or Lyft driver would be on the road."
b'With so many people unemployed, this strike is going to be really hard to pull off and their jobs may not be waiting for them.\n\nInstacart keeps getting caught being a dickhead.'
b"You can't strike if you're not employed. Other workers will just fill your place. We tried it with Uber. Granted, there wasn't a pandemic going on."
b'Instacart pricing is so unfair. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been avoiding it.'
b'How do I join and scab?'
b'I sympathize with them, I really do.  I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out what a good plan would be.  The healthcare workers are unable to obtain enough PPEs, but somehow we are going to be able to find enough PPEs for all grocery workers as well?  So what\xe2\x80\x99s next then, grocery workers quit, but that would hurt the public more right?  If we support grocery workers to quit, do we support physicians and nurses to quit too? Then what really happens, just let people die?  More deaths, increased looting, etc.  \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good solution, I feel bad for them, but I also don\xe2\x80\x99t know know how the general public will survive if all grocery shoppers quit.\n\nPeople also talk about universal pays, but one of the driving forces here that keeps these utility workers and grocery workers stocked, is that people need work and pay.  I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know that if there would ever be enough of these workers who are intrinsically motivated enough to come and work for the good of humankind without needing pay as a factor'
b"What happened to those amazon delivery drones? I used to think they were a bad idea but maybe now's the time to automate everything?"
b'I hope a lot of employees get to put their bosses over a barrel during this crisis and demand better wages and working conditions.'
b'Instacart is terrible and needs to die.'
b'Good for them!'
b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a gig/contractor company and not an actual hired job with benefits etc also arnt gig/contractor jobs like this a side job for a lot of people to make a little extra money? Just wondering why people assume that this type of job is I\xe2\x80\x99m right has any compensation for people that arnt actually hired by the company and can not take assignments any time like amazon flex drivers. Just a general question. Thank you whoever answers my question.'
b"Well, I'm bummed.  Canceling my order and will go shop myself. I was using curb side pickup.  I used the service for the first time this past week because they were short on motorized carts.  As it is, if I place an order today, I can't get it until next Wednesday. Hard to plan around sales."
b'How do independent contractors strike?'
b"....millions of people are suddenly unemployed. I wouldn't be surprised if Instacart just hired however many of them and waived the background check requirement. It's not morally correct, but it's the strategically correct response from an economic standpoint."
b"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/shiptshoppers] [Instacart Shoppers are going on strike next week.

b"Hi all - I'm chiming in to share a google doc that i've started with the specific goal of keeping employers accountable for their treatment of employees during and after this pandemic. Like many of us, I've been sitting in my apartment browsing twitter over the past two weeks and every few hours another tweet or article pops up highlighting callous or greedy behavior by a company at the expense of its employees. There is so much coronavirus-related news coming out that it feels like this news is being washed away as quickly as it is reported.\n\nThis felt wrong to me - in a big way.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - there are a lot of layoffs and furloughs happening, and I understand that not all of them are unfair or abusive. I know that many businesses are going out of their way to take care of their employees as best they can, all while attempting to ensure that there is a business for those employees to return to once this is all over. Still, I think we need to know who is treating their employees poorly during this time and, more importantly, we need to remember those names and what they did after this pandemic is over. I'm asking for the following information: who is the company, what did they do, and a link to an article or tweet as proof.\n\nIf you don't want to post directly to the google doc you can DM me the info here or tweet at me - i'm covidconfident1 on twitter - and I would be happy to input it for you.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eA5aPZxNlIjy5RfWTBCbHjWjEPfgDlh8sbbhs-RSrHA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eA5aPZxNlIjy5RfWTBCbHjWjEPfgDlh8sbbhs-RSrHA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThanks in advance for your time, and stay healthy!"
b"Fuck. I hope not. I have an order for Monday that I've been waiting a week for. I have no way of getting out to get groceries until then. I sure hope not. There are many folks who rely on deliveries."
b"If you are thinking about becoming an Instacart worker, then just go get a job at your favorite/nearest union grocery store.  They have a protected wage, benefits, sick pay etc.   I don't know why one would choose to be at a grocery store all day for less."
b'I hope they get whatever they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWorker demands include that Instacart provide hazard pay of an additional $5 per order; give shoppers free hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and soap; and offer expanded paid sick leave to include workers with preexisting conditions who have been told to stay home by their doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGod Forbid'

b'Power to the workers.'
b"Who wants to go shopping?\n\nApparently China is not afraid of the pandemic, all online shopping sites are closed across the world due to COVID-19 outbreak, but I guess there's no limit to desire, isn't it?\n\nSo if anyone who hasn't manged to buy something they always desired for quite sometime, now maybe the best time, Aliexpress can ship your product with free samples of COVID-19 in just few days... \n\nWow!

b'They\xe2\x80\x99re just going to increase prices customers have to pay to offset the cost anyway, just do it already.

b"I received two weeks worth of groceries from Instacart yesterday afternoon, these people are doing Gods work. I tipped my shopper $25 above the defaulted app amount. I hope this strike doesn't happen in Canada but they also deserve what they are asking for."
b'Chances of this being any more successful than the Uber "strike" of last year?'
b'[removed]'
b'Not using instacart'
b"I think about this whenever I use Instacart. In the meanwhile, I've just been tipping really well, and for both our sakes, having them just leave the groceries at the door"
b"If you are out driving, you have to give them the honk of support. These guys are starting the workers demands for fairness from their employers. And it's life or death, but also fair and basic fucking respect and decency so they better get what they are asking for."
b'Same thing in France. One thing they want is to stop to refill non essentials items in supermarket selling foods'
b'At times like this I realize how spoiled I am by my grocery chain HEB. I hope these workers can reach an agreement.'
b'Aw man I just made my first order two days ago. *Supposed* to be here Wednesday \xf0\x9f\x98\x91'
b'[removed]'
b'I HOPE SOMEONE SEES THIS. US SHIPT SHOPPERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING. \n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re onboarding new people and orders pay $6-12 without tip. Oddly enough , in my metro , we were getting a $125 bonus 2 weeks in a row. We got the bonus for completing more than 30 orders without surge. That was about 2-3 weeks ago. \n\nSince the pandemic we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any bonuses. Just encouraging emails and $50 if we refer a friend \n\nI posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiptShoppers/comments/fpzwi2/at_what_point_does_shipt_decide_our_lives_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nI hope this becomes a top comment.'
b'All I can say is that I wish them luck.'
b'We more unions!'
b'Nice. Lots of people could use some extra income right now and will gladly sign up to take the place of the strikers.'
b'Hello inflation?'
b'There is power in a union! \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbzxemJZIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbzxemJZIc)'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s gig work. Someone will happily take the gig. Not sure how much sway they will have and Instacart is not exactly set up to distribute PPE to its workers.'
b'Fuck instacart!!!'
b"I'm sure there are plenty of more instacart workers ready to take those orders..this will be a drop in the bucket"
b'Vanessa Bain, a California Instacart shopper leading the strike, pointed out the disparity between full-time Instacart employees staying at home with full benefits and gig workers who are risking their health. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout [us], Instacart will grind to a halt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. This is garbage. Who does this? They\xe2\x80\x99re filling in for regular employees who are home and still want to do less than the bare minimum. And no, anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s home now, having been laid off is going to take the unemployment over that BS. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do better than $2400/month. Good luck.'
b'A lot of essential businesses are showing their employees are not. "We\'re giving you a paycheck. That\'s all were required to do. We\'ll let you know if someone tests positive And though we\'re not giving you protections or benefits you decide what to do with that And closing depends on what\'s happening day by day."\n\nAnd that\'s what the govt gave us when they said essential businesses stay open without giving responsibility in what that meant. \n\nKaren\'s and Ken\'s fuck you because you may need to save a dollar, but I\'m not paid enough to put up with your bullshit while I\'m using my own money to sanitize the phone i have to listen to your bullshit through.'
b"I've been on strike since the 25th but mostly because the shopper app sucks total fucking ass lol"
b'I literally signed up to work for them today. I have an illness that makes me unable to work most days, and Instacart has no minimums, so I can work as little as I need. \n\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all except I can\xe2\x80\x99t get approved for disability, and I need money or I\xe2\x80\x99m going to lose everything and die. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any possessions left to sell.\n\nPushing myself to work at all is going to kill me anyways, especially with this virus going around, but.. just, damn. Goddammit. Fuck.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m glad my delivery is scheduled for Sunday!'
b'It takes about two weeks to get approved.  They have to do background checks and what not. Two weeks is a long time for a company that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had to shut down yet.'
b'Instacart is already trying to hire 300,000 people which is crazy, so this would complicate things both with hiring and retention.'
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong.  Amazon does the same thing with flex drivers.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t do Instacart, but I am a rideshare driver. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this strike stuff a bunch of times already and to be brutally honest, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why:\n\nFirst and foremost, the biggest hurdle is the decentralized nature of the workforce. All drivers don\xe2\x80\x99t report to one single office, they log in from wherever they are, or wherever they sign up to drive in. Because of this, it\xe2\x80\x99s neigh on impossible to get 100% of the workforce to strike. \n\nPiggybacking off of the above paragraph, the second issue is with the workforce itself. In rideshare, (and I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with Instacart), you have people doing it from all over the spectrum. Some are disgruntled at the conditions, while others are just happy to have a job. The disgruntled ones will strike, but there are more people who just want to earn. The earners will continue to work because $5 is $5. The business could cut the rates by 2/3 and the earners will still be out there driving because that\xe2\x80\x99s money in their pockets. Additionally, there are people out there who will sign up anyways. They know the risks, they know the pay scale, and they sign up anyways. Basically, there\xe2\x80\x99s always fresh meat for the grinder. \n\nSo to sum it all up, in jobs like this, a strike is nice, but ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s useless. It\xe2\x80\x99ll make the news, but the blip on the company\xe2\x80\x99s radar will be negligible.'
b'[removed]'
b"Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, McDonald's employees all need to unite & make demands en masse, to achieve anything of substance."
b'Yeah it would be definitely outside the norm for one of these newer gig-based employers to bow to their employees'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re doing a mass hiring right now, so unfortunately yes you may be right'
b'[removed]'
b'Is the pay for instacart jobs even worth it? With boosted unemployment you can make around 30k a year in unemployment for a single person.'
b"MOnday will come and go.  There's no fucking masks for anyone."
b"You're not. At all."
b'If only people had morals and refused to scab'
b"They're not even going to cancel their accounts.  Nothing's going to happen because of this."
b'I hope they get prosecuted for using a pandemic to boost their position by monopolizing laboe'
b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s the highest unemployment rates ever.'
b'Lol yeah. Going on strike when there is 30% unemployment is not a very strategic decision.'
b'Personally I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go apply for an employer that has workers on strike. No matter how dire my situation. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s just an example of how they\xe2\x80\x99d treat me.\n\nAlso I won\xe2\x80\x99t be patronizing them with my business. Instacart can go sit on a cactus. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be supporting a business that treats employees as expandable and replaceable.'
b'Caremongering has strong political affiliations though with many members proudly preaching about anarchy and very leftist views. They believe caremongering is to take care of the socially disadvantaged and therein lies close affiliations with ideologies that eliminate the social constructs which put people at a disadvantage. \n\nI joined a Facebook caremongering group thinking what you said above and was some what shocked at the narrative, so I DMed an admin and they confirmed the above.'
b'If you have a good driver next time, ask if you can pay them directly with dumpling (www.dumpling.us). Its sort of like a white label instacart. They get to keep a lot more of the money.\n\nThey probably know what it is and would *love* to connect with you there rather than through Instacart. Its very popular on /r/InstacartShoppers\n\nETA: looks like there is a directory of shoppers on their website. Maybe there is someone in your zip:\nhttps://shop.dumpling.us/'
b'Same. See if you have a local store that has delivery. Those delivery people are employees of the store. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we will do'
b"One thing that's good for you is that they're demanding free hand sanitizer and disinfectinant wipes."
b"My wife is in the same boat and we've been heavily reliant on Instacart the last two weeks. This is going to suck."
b'Fuck, you should download the Nextdoor app and see if a neighbor can help you out. I see people doing that all the time in my neighborhood'
b"Check out Shipt, it's a very similar service which offers delivery from many grocery stores.  It's owned by Target and is the primary delivery partner for them.  You can pay a monthly payment or I believe there is a yearly membership which comes out cheaper. I've been using the service for a while now and it can be a life saver.  Here's the referral code it gave me to share.  It gives a $10 credit towards your grocery order.\n https://www.shipt.com/groceries/?r=D42A13"
b'I agree. Their protection is my protection. I fully support the strike.\n\nI use Instacart to supply two households.    I will switch my food deliveries to other sources during the strike.'
b"There might be local groups of going healthy people doing food deliveries for free. Typically it's for older people but they may help for people at risk in other ways"
b'Yo, I\xe2\x80\x99m also an asthmatic (on the severe side). Are we at a higher risk? Yes. But there has been absolutely nothing conclusive that states we have a higher mortality rate. I saw one source say it\xe2\x80\x99s a 6% mortality, but harsher lung conditions such as COPD were clumped in there. \n\nNow, am I saying we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry? Absolutely not, I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely still worried! But saying it\xe2\x80\x99ll kill people like us is a stretch.'
b"Where do you live my friend? I'm sure you can find people willing to deliver you groceries voluntarily to help out. I'd do it if I was close."
b'Amongst the other suggestions you\xe2\x80\x99re getting, maybe a neighbor? I would be more than happy to help any of my neighbors with something like this and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know most of their names.'
b'Amazon prime has Amazon Now, which delivers from their warehouse and whole foods for free, except tip.'
b'Shipt'
b"I'm right there with you. Congenital lung disease, corona will kill me. I have an Instacart delivery scheduled for the 31st, a day after the strike begins.\n\nGood for them, but fuck man. I may have to try dumpling as someone here suggested."
b'Im in the same boat as you.'
b"Same. Ask a healthy friend or coworker if they'd be willing to go out on your behalf! Pay them or offer a favor in return. Stock up for a couple weeks at a time though to minimize their exposure."
b"So you have family who you can ask to shop for you while this whole thing passes over? I'm doing grocery runs for my grandma and senior aged mom and step father \n."
b"> I got asthma. This virus will kill me.\n\nThat's not a guarantee. Otherwise we'd be pulling the nurses with asthma away from patient care."
b'See if any local individuals have decided to start their own temporary grocery delivery service. Some college students near me were bored but also happen to be responsible, so they decided to occupy themselves with picking up and delivering groceries for a reasonable fee. There also might just be helpful people who would do it even without an added fee if you explain you have asthma.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same boat. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t left my apartment in two weeks due to asthma. Finally got an Instacart reservation in a busy area . . . and it\xe2\x80\x99s for Monday.\n\nBut I also really appreciate these shoppers and want them to be paid fairly and given the safety gear necessary.'
b'> I got asthma. This virus will kill me. \n\nNot necessarily! Check out stories in /r/CoronavirusAsthma if you need some reassurance.'
b"Holy shit, I'm so sorry for your loss dude."
b'Sorry for your loss'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to hear that. Please know that she was doing something heroic in the face of the grave danger this pandemic has placed upon us. I know this sounds improbable but we may not know how many lives she saved just by keeping vulnerable and sick people out of our public areas and grocery stores. \n\nI wish you and your family all the best in this difficult time.'
b"I'm so sorry. May her memory be for a blessing, and my love to you, your family, and all of her loved ones."
b'my heart just aches for you. sending love.'
b"That is the worst news I've heard all day. I am so, so sorry friend."
b'Sorry homie, universal blessings'
b'Internet doubt.'
b'Huh?'
b'What does that have to do with this besides her working for instacart?\n\nDriving fatalities are unfortunately common for all people everywhere.'
b"That's awesome! And hey, if they get what they're asking for, then you can use this useful service"
b'Fuck, you should write to instacart telling them that you need their service and that they better give the strikers what they need ASAP'
b'Make sure you tip them well! And in cash, if possible.'
b'Omg the Schwan\xe2\x80\x99s truck!  Something I completely forgot I remembered until reading this.'
b'Growing up, my grandparents always had Schwan\xe2\x80\x99s ice cream cups stocked in the freezer. So good!'
b"I still see the Schwann's truck around!"
b'Schwan\xe2\x80\x99s cheese tortellini and chocolate ice cream bars are the taste of my childhood.'
b'Okay but only if they bring back those pizza wonton rolls'
b"They were still in my area recently in California.  Dunno if they're still going with the shutdown - I'd consider them to be essential..."
b'The tips dont even really go to the drivers fyi. Tip nothing or tip cash on instacart.'
b'I have like a crate of paper towels for this very reason. And basically no TP.'
b'Please make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re cash tips for the added/hazard pay you\xe2\x80\x99re being nice enough to offer, so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t kept by the platform.'
b'Not trying to sound like an ass. But why do you do it?'
b'People are desperate for jobs they could easily replace everyone who leaves in a week.'
b'*all'
b'Delivery drivers generally can\'t unionize because they aren\'t considered "employees" under federal law'
b'unions in theory are good but a lot of them over time do nothing but hurt the industries they support because the union leaders are more worried about protecting their high paying jobs and multiple pensions than actually saving the careers of their union workers. \n\nOnce politics takes over, the union is doomed. See Detroit, big city construction, etc.'
b"Same. Now we just need stores to update their stock or for people to stop hoarding so that the app's inventory updates.. No bread, no milk, no eggs, no pasta, no water, for over 3 weeks at my 5 local stores."
b'As a shipt shopper, ppl like you were why I continued shopping.  It was a hard pill to swallow when I realized I was putting my life at risk too. Especially since I have an autoimmune disease. \n\nSome of us shoppers are literally having to choose between possible exposure or a roof over our heads. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in a large metro area too (Atlanta) \n\nShipt said we would get assistance if we were sick. However, they\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to pay people who can\xe2\x80\x99t get tested and they are not accepting doctors notes. The issue is, tests are so limited here that you\xe2\x80\x99re being told to stay home 14 days. \n\nEven with doing door drop offs, Shipt is putting their customers in danger by these bureaucratic procedures. your shopper could be sick, but still working because they need the money. This is concerning since the virus lasts on hard surfaces , including shopping bags. \n\nI talked about it briefly [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiptShoppers/comments/fpzwi2/at_what_point_does_shipt_decide_our_lives_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)'
b'Damn you tried going outside and doing it yourself?'
b'Saddest shit ever was that my instacart last week was a guy and his 10 year old daughter hauling bags around'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about Instacart. But I work for Shipt. I was put in isolation by a doctor for 2 weeks. Because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get tested, Shipt refused to provide financial assistance. Even after proving that my state doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough tests so they\xe2\x80\x99re prioritizing medical employees and telling everyone to stay at home. I even had a doctors note. \n\nThey said they would only accept isolation orders from the cdc or who. The problem is, to get those orders YOU HAVE TO GET TESTED. \n\nYou see the issue ???? They drafted these statements weeks ago, assuming we would have enough tests. When that clearly was not the case, they\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to update the policy. \n\nThey create these policies because it sounds good for PR. However, in reality , it\xe2\x80\x99s hurting the shoppers who are risking their lives. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m immunocompromised. It\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult decision for me because this was my main source of income.'
b"Fuck it hard. Some shit called Jyve made me leave a vendor management position I had for 2 years. Took away all of my regular merchandisers and replaced them with some random fuck or another that I couldn't hold accountable for anything."
b'Do you live in a major city?\n\nI just signed up, and I got at LEAST 60 notifications on my phone today for batches ($35 average) without leaving my house. Granted, I live in the middle of Chicago, though.'
b'Is instacart in the USA different from Canada? My sibling has been doing instacart for a while, and i just got on with them. We dont have to sit in a designated lot waiting for orders, they just appear and you sit at home picking the ones you want to do when you want to.'
b'Given that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s EPA has shut down environmental enforcement, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the NLRB shuts down union-formation votes.'
b'Never waste a tragedy to push your agenda. Perfect time to hold people hostage'
b"They've replaced my fennel with oranges..."
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it'
b"The pool of people who will do this kind of job, and do it well enough to keep the business afloat, is not infinite. 50% of any newcomers to this absurd business won't make it past the first day."
b'You gotta be kidding me....smh. Thats bs'
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re just a stupid consumer. Read the terms before you sign up you illiterate cunt. They explain their pricing structure etc. \n\nAnd 100% of tips DO go to employees. But it offsets the amount that they get from Instacart just like a waitress\xe2\x80\x99 tips offset her hourly wages.'
b'Maybe that should be on the minds of *those in corporate at Instacart*, and should encourage them to get the needed protections to their employees.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the workers & they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be villainized, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the company. \n\nNot to mention, without protections how are they to keep from being the very carriers that threaten their 80 year old one-lunged customers?  If you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about them you should be supporting this action.'
b"Wow you're right. Sounds like Instacart shoppers are an extremely valuable and important position that should be compensated fairly, and that they deserve safe working conditions for the critical services they are providing."
b"Fuck, you're not wrong. But there are other ways to get deliveries and you can't blame people for fighting for safer conditions. Hopefully 80 year olds with one lung have family and neighbors that they can reach out to"
b'You do know that there are other delivery services, right?'
b"> This will force 80 year-olds with one lung back into the stores. You guys know that, right?\n\n\nOh I know, what I don't know is why you are blaming the striking workers instead of the millionaire corporation that is guilty for this happening though.\n\nWhat you said, it's the corporation's fault, not the fault of the workers."
b'Multi-BILLION dollar corporation treats workers like shit and takes advantage of them during a global crisis.  And your response is, "why don\'t the workers think about the people they\'re affecting?!"  Fuck off with that bullshit.'
b'As it currently is, the only way I can get deliveries is to start the process now and plan for the delivery to come five days later.'
b'Done reading other comments in this thread it sounds like 100% of the tip in the app does go to the gig workers and not the company. On top of that, it was stated that if you offer no tip, when having the option of picking up the order, the app lets the shopper know, and they will often pass on taking it.'
b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s Shipt , be careful. [they\xe2\x80\x99re treating us just the same. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiptShoppers/comments/fpzwi2/at_what_point_does_shipt_decide_our_lives_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re owned by target, so if you order on target.com a Shipt shopper is delivering your order'
b"That's what I thought too. I've never heard of independent contractors ever getting benefits"
b'There are in store shoppers as well that are paid hourly'
b"The problem isn't just protection from the virus. It's a deep well of distrust and disdain of a company that has routinely cheated and underpaid its workers for years now. The virus is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Instacart has done nothing to engender a sense of loyalty in their shoppers, and everything to foment a sense of devaluation and distrust. So when the proverbial poo hits the fan, whoppers have just reached a breaking point."
b'Some of the employees are nice, I work at Costco.\n\nSome of them are inconsiderate assholes.'
b"Seriously.  We have 3 stores nearby enough to easily shop at.\n\nShoprite: Does their own delivery/curbside pickup service.  No markup on food, and the cubside pickup is $10 for under a $50 order or $5 for an order over $50.  Fan-fucking-tastic.\n\nWhole Foods: free delivery over $35 with Prime, no other markups to worry about.  Even better.\n\nWegmans: Partners with Instacart.  There's like 7 different fees tacked on so by the time you get to the end of your order, you've somehow thrown a solid $15+ onto your purchase price before you even think about a tip.  Curbside isn't really any better.  And now I see they're treating their employees like shit.  Fuck Instacart extra hard."
b'Yes it is a gig job but lots and lots of people do these for more than just side money. They either need the extra money to survive or they do it full time.'
b"If I understand it right, most of the people that work there are contractors, so gig economy job. But there are some people who only do the shopping, and then pass their orders onto a contracted driver, and those shoppers are actual employees. I could be wrong though, I've never worked that job before."
b'There are in store shoppers that are hired part time, so not all Instacart workers are delivery drivers with a gig job'
b"https://shop.dumpling.us/\n\nThe ethical, empowering version of Instacart.\n\nPlus, as a customer, you get the benefit of having a dedicated shopper who knows your needs and can literally shop at any store you desire.\n\nHope there's a shopper in your area."
b'There are millions of unemployed people the ceos won\xe2\x80\x99t care they can just hire someone else.'
b'Better hours, schedule things on your time, childcare, etc.'
b"Someone should get that toddler to nap, it seems he's not been getting enough sleep, otherwise he may be a complete moron, but not cranky, he just wants others to do stuff for him and continue to pay him respect, while he funds a documentary about his private jet..."
b'Won\xe2\x80\x99t happen. They\xe2\x80\x99re independent contractors.'

b'My background check vendor just told me that checks were going to start being slow due to non essential government shutdowns and some counties would likely stop returning results entirely for the time being'
b'They will just do like amazon warehouses are doing, defer background checks and drug testing to a later date.'
b"Christ, I'm glad I haven't had to find a job in years. Sounds like trying to get a damn security clearance."
b'I just signed up today not knowing about this strike. The time between downloading the app and being able to take my first delivery was about two hours.'
b'I just signed up 2 days ago and got approved instantly and got the credit card to use today early morning so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna try tomorrow'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re fast tracking at the moment. Just had a friend sign up two days ago and is already shopping today.'
b'Took me 1 week. Technically a few hours (application process) but had to wait for the card to come in'
b"Hpw do all the IC shoppers know about the strike? I'm confused about how the people planning it go the information to everyone because only IC has their contact information."
b'Agree. They might have some leverage here.'
b'It took me two days to get an instacart job including getting my card to buy the groceries'
b'I just recently got approved took 5 days'
b'I get background checked every month for my job. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually takes around 10 minutes. Just submitted one today and had it back within the hour.'
b'Can confirm. I am a bartender and was laid off on the 14th. My background check for Instacart just cleared today, and I signed up on the 14th.'
b'They probably have a wave of people already in the pipeline ready to take those jobs, they had to of had an inkling that this was gonna happen.'
b'Yeah, but I can guarantee you not all Instacart workers will participate in the "strike".  It will probably be a smaller percentage than people think.'
b'>They have to do background checks and what not.\n\nDoes Instacart actually have to do that or is that just something they implemented to make customers feel safe?'

b'I just leave them cash with a note on the doorbell since I opt for the no contact drop off. They deserve every penny.

b'You\xe2\x80\x99re right about lung diseases like COPD and emphysema but here\xe2\x80\x99s the catch: those diseases are more common in groups who already share co-morbidities like being old and being a smoker.  \n  \nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had severe asthma my whole life so I\xe2\x80\x99m paying particularly close attention to all of this. I hate to say it, but the most common underlying condition I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing among young people in bad shape with covid19 is asthma. It\xe2\x80\x99s also hard to trust any of the data right now with limited testing and deaths being improperly attributed to other illnesses.  \n  \nThat said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole subreddit over at /r/coronavirusasthma with a thread of recoveries.

b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to write them a strongly worded email tonight.'
b'Yes!  \n\nPressure Instacart.\n\n100%'
b'Huh? No, definitely don\'t "tip nothing", whether the full tip goes to the driver or not, they still get something, so should still tip\n\nAlso, I\'ve done Instacart delivery before and I didn\'t grab orders that didn\'t have a tip (you can see the Instacart payment amount and the tip amount separately). You never know if the customer is going to give you cash, most the time they don\'t, so not worth the risk'
b'Yep I always tip cash'
b'I tipped on the initial order at 15% and then left cash on the porch for the remainder of the tip.'

b'Please don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to this person. Instacart doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep tips and if you zero your tip out you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get your order picked up.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t.  I cherry pick, which means I only accept and complete orders that I deem acceptable.  However, other people do complete these types of orders because they feel pressured and manipulated.  The companies will often state you will be rewarded if you have an higher acceptance rate.  Which is not true.  Also, the companies are starting to hide the full payout amount.  So, an order for $5 that is 10 miles away might actually be $25...but the company is hiding the full payout.  They feel like if the amount is sometimes hidden it will force drivers to complete every order.  It\xe2\x80\x99s awful.'
b'I think that the people who got laid off should collect unemployment (the bar has been lowered due to the virus) and wait out the crisis. Then, when everything is over, they can go back to their old jobs.'

b"You are here discussing a hypothetical end instead of the power of collective labor to make people's lives better.\n\nYou are the reason Instacart workers have to strike.\n\nAmazon warehouse and driver/contractors need to strike, too.\n\nShit ... so does the USPS, FedEx and their contractors, and UPS.\n\nWalmart, Albertsons, Kroger ... all y'all now is the chance."
b'This was in California, San Francisco area about 5 years ago. I really hope that they changed it because it was terrible to have to \xe2\x80\x9cclock in\xe2\x80\x9d by driving to some random grocery store parking lot and hitting a button on the app that you had arrived and then just sit there waiting for an order to come in.'
b'It must be different now, which is good. I was doing it in California and I had to park my car in a designated parking lot that they had chosen (because \xe2\x80\x98it was near grocery stores that you would likely pick,\xe2\x80\x99) and just wait. If an order came in you\xe2\x80\x99d have a couple minutes to accept it or it would go to someone else.

b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no way for us to know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a black box. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99ll combine your order with a couple of others. They pay one base fee when they do this. So if the other two people don\xe2\x80\x99t tip, the whole order would be 15 for us. If it was just your order, it would still be 15.'
b"No, Instacart and other companies have this disgusting practice where they basically top the driver up to a certain amount. So if you tip more, Instacart pays them less. So when you tip you're just paying Instacart's bills for them.\n\nFor example: \n\nScenario A: you tip $10, Instacart gives the driver $2 for a total of $12.\n\nScenario B: you tip $5, Instacart gives the driver $7 for a total of $12.\n\nIf you can tip in cash do it - that way the driver gets more $ from Instacart, plus your tip. Some people say to put $.44 in the tip line if you plan to tip cash, as a signal to the driver.\n\nInstacart also marks up every individual item and keeps that too, plus the membership fee. If you pay someone directly with dumpling or another arrangement they get to keep those fees.\n\nSadly all the gig companies do this (except Uber maybe makes a point of not doing it? can't recall). Regular taxis do this too actually. It sucks.\n\nThere was an article about it in the NYTimes a while back if you want to research it more."
b'No. Instacart steals some.'
b"companies usually take percentages of credit card tips, or sometimes they even count them towards the hourly wage of employees up to a point, see [tip credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped_wage). this is because most companies treat workers like scum. this doesn't happen with cash tips since the employees just pocket them."
b"Does Walmart deliver? They've been expanding a lot and even my sister who lives in the middle of nowhere can get them to her place now. It's a much better deal and there's free shipping codes all the time."
b'The Canadian in me sees the Canadian in you'
b'Is there any way to let the driver know that you *are* going to tip in cash?'
b'No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. 100% of tips go directly to us. If you clear the tip portion, your order likely won\xe2\x80\x99t get picked up. even if you intend on giving cash, we have no way of knowing.'

b"Can we get some people who have worked for these delivery services to weigh in on the other ones? I'm pretty sure grubhub and ubereats don't do this, and doordash got in trouble for it in the past but they changed it.\n\nI keep seeing people on reddit saying everyone does it but I'm not sure if that's actually true.\n\nIt would be great to get a real accurate list so we can know who we should support.\n\nI can tell you I used to deliver for Panera and we got to keep all our tips."
b'This is pretty inaccurate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tracked plenty of orders that I\xe2\x80\x99ve completed with equal amounts and types of items and pay stays pretty consistent, regardless of tip size. \n\nThe code also isn\xe2\x80\x99t .44 it was .11, but many new drivers don\xe2\x80\x99t know that and if you leave a small tip or no tip, regardless if you plan on giving cash, won\xe2\x80\x99t get picked up. Best way to get good service and a happy shopper is a large tip, given directly through the app. Any cash after is certainly a nice bonus, but most drivers want to see a good tip on the app first'

b'It\'s about insurance. If you can tell the insurance company "all our drivers have 100% clean driving records going back 5 years and we don\'t hire anyone who\'s ever had a DUI or been cited for driving with a suspended license" or whatever, your insurance rates are going to be a lot cheaper than a company that hires lots of drivers and doesn\'t do any kind of background check.'

b"Intentional or not, this is a good thing for Grocery store workers. With the massive unemployment dump they (grocery store workers), with virtually no leverage to begin with, lost the little they had.\n\nNow, they have massive leverage. If grocery stores dont meet their demands, as you note, they can make more unemployed. And Grocery Stores cant easily replace them because, again, unemployment pays so well.\n\nThe grocery store would have to shut down at a time when they're registering record profits.\n\nIf you're pro-Grocery Store worker, this is a god send. All you have to do is organize and demand better. Dont get your demands? Go home, isolate, play Madden, and make more off unemployment than you were before.\n\nRight?"
b"federal government: do whatever it takes to keep people from being hungry, homeless, and ready to start work again when the pandemic subsides.\n\nDon't be so dense."
b'You should also know that Instacart overcharges you A LOT! Maybe 30% more than the store price. We are told to take off stickers and prices tags. \n\nPlease tip in cash.

b'Yeah, Instacart is trash when it comes to fair pay. When I still used the service I always tipped in cash, never in the app.'
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re a good person.'
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right. I got a cash tip today and had an absolute panic attack. I was grateful for the money, but I had so much stress with the what if\xe2\x80\x99s.'
b'Ah, but my cash is washable! Checkmate.'
b"She probably did, but possibly she did not. Over the last year or two, there has been a lot of evidence posted in the IC shopper subreddit that suggests Instacart keeps or skims tips on a certain amount of orders per day. It was always my theory that they do it to a small percentage a day (maybe 5%) and randomly across all markets so it's difficult to see a pattern and evidence is hard to pin down.\n\nThat 5% would be an enormous amount of money over time."
b'The original article is\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/nyregion/doordash-ubereats-food-app-delivery-bike.amp.html\n\nAnd the article about doordash  changing their tipping method in response to the original is\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/nyregion/doordash-tip-policy.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article'
b'Its really not "on me" to do shit. Do your own research, reddit is not my job. [Here\'s the article though anyway]\n(https://www.nytimes.com./2019/07/21/nyregion/doordash-ubereats-food-app-delivery-bike.html).\n\nThat said, here\'s a perfect example from today:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/fpxdyb/these_payouts_are_not_consistent_to_each_other_at/\n\n3 very similar orders. Two ~$10 tips, one $20 tip. On the $10 tips IC paid the driver $20, but on the $20 tip they only added $10. All three orders combined to roughly the same total (~$30) of tip + Instacart payment. This is their standard MO.\n\nIC has changed to this weird auction model where they slowly increase their fee until some poor schlub takes it, so they can now say the driver gets 100% of the tip and be technically correct, but its just a modified form of the same shenanigans. But I\'m not going to explain it to you, research it yourself if you don\'t believe me.'
b"It wasn't .11. It was .22."
b'Yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to get good service with a good tip listed in the app. We\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to spend time communicating and searching for the best items and replacements available.'
b'No worries - the info you have is valuable too & a good clarification.'
b"With all of these millions of people out of a job and relegated to doing the underpaid and completely unsteady work of Instacart, the economy will not be strong enough to support the need for a company such as this.\n\nIt couldn't before, really, without Instacart doing everything in its power to hide the true cost of the service by using every method available to nickle and dime customers without them knowing unless they *really* dug into the difference in cost."

b"Amazon warehouse workers are stressed to not only the point of urinating in bottles to maintain efficiency (serious, countless reports verify this, some wear diapers instead) but even management laughs about the peecups and just throws them away when they find them.\n\nPay/benefits/etc are solid for an entry-level position, but you'll be busting ass constantly, supervision will genuinely never be happy with your efficiency percentage, you'll always be hounded to move faster every single day (penalties include hours cut and eventually termination.)"
b'Sorry for the delay the other guy summed it up well. The working conditions suck, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s a warehouse after all. They are going to constantly push you to work harder and faster, no matter how hard and fast you work. You will have certain numbers to hit and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up you\xe2\x80\x99ll get fired. They are modern day slave drivers. Worst job I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. The pay is decent given how easy it is to get hired but not worth imo given the grueling work and how they treat you. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather deliver on an app or work at a pizza place.'
b'yeah the taxes take a bit cut out of whatever profit you make doing gig jobs.'
b'Academic studies have been done that takes all costs associated with being an uber driver into account and when all is said and done most of them aren\xe2\x80\x99t even netting minimum wage. Some are actually making less than nothing. The same is probably true for Instacart.'
b"totally correct in theory, although in practice grocery stores' margins are already razor thin so it's anyone's guess what sort of effects this will have. i'm not totally sure if any provisions will be made for the new unemployment stipend but this might just keep current employees enslaved by the stores, since quitting typically disqualifies one from receiving unemployment payouts."
b'You have to be laid off to get unemployment. You quit, no unemployment for you!'
b'Do any states give you unemployment benefits if you quit (without a very valid reason)?'
b"it's just interesting that they'd do more to keep people without essential jobs from being homeless than to keep those with essential jobs from being homeless."
b"That's why I never use Instacart, as a shopper I know the prices don't match. So not only are you paying their administrative fee, but you're paying more for groceries."
b"Yeah I use instacart right now and it's ridiculous.  I paid $9 for like 4 slices of ham - that's gotta be like $4-5 max at the store.  And I'm already paying $100 a year for the membership.  \n\nI have been tipping doordash delivery folks in cash every since I heard doordash was being scummy and keeping some of the tips.  Need to remember to do that for instacart too."
b"> Instacart overcharges you A LOT! Maybe 30% more than the store price.\n\nFrom what I understand, this is on the stores. The stores are responsible for setting the prices in instacart, so if they enter their prices as higher than the shelf price, which I assume the stores do to cope with their own instacart fees, then the consumer gets stuck with the higher price.\n\nI could be wrong but I think instacart charges both the customer a fee *and* the store a fee, so that's why the store enters a higher price."
b'Door dash does the same too. They count the tip as part of the pay so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t included on top of their standard fee/pay.'
b'What if the tip is in a small ziplock bag?  Would that help at all or am I just being stupid and making your life harder?\n\nI just hate the idea of a scummy company keeping the money meant for the workers.'
b"You can put the cash in an envelope (if it's not already in an envelope) and quarantine it for a day. I have read that the virus survives 1 day on paper/cardboard."
b'> Its really not "on me" to do shit. Do your own research\n\nwhy would you ever include this in a post?'
b"That's ass backwards. Tips should be based on service. Service shouldn't be based on tips.\n\nWhat happens if I give a good tip and receive poor service?"
b'My comment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything to do with privacy or my thoughts on the merits of either system - there are dangers in both, in fact these manual methods often have terrible repercussions due to inaccurate data or bad matching, or just lazy work by the wrong contractor.  \n\nAside from that - yes, much needs to be done to rectify & maintain our right to privacy.  There are a good many existing evils & worse shit on the horizon in the background check industry.'

b"> My sister-in-law works for Amazon in application processing. They'd hire murderers right now just to fill the need.

b"I really can't understand why Americans are putting up with this. From what I read (mostly here on Reddit), almost everyone seems to suffer from these horrible working conditions, unaffordable healthcare and so on, yet people keep voting for politicians that encourage this. Is the group of badly paid and badly insured people just overrepresented on Reddit or is there another reason for this?"
b"It's just infuriating ftfy"
b"I'll pay slightly more for groceries at the moment to not have to browse and interact with everyone in a grocery store.\n\nOpportunity costs."
b'I was told by Doordash drivers that that\'s no longer the case.\n\nWhat they were doing, which was shady af, was guaranteeing drivers a flat rate for the delivery.  So say it was $5.  If you didn\'t tip, Doordash paid them $5.  If you tipped $3, Doordash paid them $2.  If you tipped $5, Doordash paid them nothing.  And Doordash could say "Our driver\'s keep 100% of their tips" and be technically truthful.\n\nBut I was told there was so much outrage over this that they changed their pay structure and tips are now in addition to the base pay.'
b'That\'s correct, item prices are completely set by the store and Instacart has no input on it.  Some stores have the same as on-shelf prices, some are higher; you can look at the stores pricing policy in the app.\n\nWhat I think is shady is that Instacart charges the delivery fee ($5.99 or whatever) and also charges a "service fee", which they hide under a "taxes and fees" category along with sales tax.  The service they\'re providing is delivery; if they need to charge more for delivery, then make the delivery fee higher and be transparent about it...'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the [exact opposite ](https://thecounter.org/a-reddit-user-calculated-instacarts-markup-its-pretty-high/) of the truth. Some stores pay Instacart a percentage for bringing in new customers. If the store isn\xe2\x80\x99t paying Instacart, Instacart will mark up the prices in the app. \n\nI go to the store and shop with a debit card. I know what the totals are. You think the stores are then recharging Instacart after they\xe2\x80\x99ve paid? Instacart never gives you sale prices. We\xe2\x80\x99re told to remove BOGO stickers for instance. I had a customer buy 3 cases of water. They were 3 for 10 on sale. She paid $6 a piece. That\xe2\x80\x99s higher than the shelf price when they aren\xe2\x80\x99t on sale.'
b"I think they recently were forced to change this because of negative press...but I still don't trust them"
b'You aren\xe2\x80\x99t being stupid. I was just having an emotional day I suppose. I guess taking cash is no more riskier than me touching items when I\xe2\x80\x99m shopping. You\xe2\x80\x99re doing a great thing by even caring. Be well.'
b"Cash is not paper though, it's cotton so how long does it last on cotton?"
b"I've said similar things, because some people can be really pushy about demanding a source when it's literally the first thing that comes up in a Google search.  If it's some obscure academic article then of course asking for a source is completely understandable.  If it's something you could find yourself in ten seconds, then stop being lazy."
b"You're looking at it wrong. It's not a tip, its a service bribe."
b'You can adjust tip up to 3 days after.'

b'This was for amazon.'
b"It reminds me of working in a concessions stand but with osha and zero ability to talk during work. There is always an order fill. The only person you can even think about talking to is the person sharing a bin rack with you, it's like a noisy yellow bookshelf so that's a treat. And your boss will randomly watch you work, to make sure your using proper form, so I hope you can pop in and out of a super deep squat like it's nothing all day or osha is coming for you.  Also they try to hype you to worker harder, it's dumb. This isn't a fucking sport. I'm not cheering for team Amazon. \n\nThis was all about picking, it's probably the worst job there so try to avoid it at all costs. If you can get into anything that doesn't track you, it's seems a lot better. I only did it for like three days but it's so nice to know you can take a piss without having to make up for it later."

b"It's not paper? Anyway, I saw a chart that included paper, cardboard and fabric as taking 1day, but I have not seen any specific studies about fabric. You could quarantine for 1 week to be extra safe."

b'Does Instacart know the product order of each store?!'
b"Sounds like a temporary job with high turnover if that's how they run the show. Horrifying to say the least, but I'd rather know that the buzzsaw is on as I walk into it. \n\nThank you for taking the time to respond, its helping me prepare mentally."
b"You act like a livable wage isn't huge for a ton of people in America."
b"So what I'm reading is if any person 18-24 lives with mom and dad, they dont get their own check and the parents dont get the 500 either. Eight"
b'Neither will their parents. Yay. Also, parents won\xe2\x80\x99t get funds for 17-18 year old high school kids either.'
b'A lot of college age kids are about to get screwed.\n\nThe dependent vs independent debate is already a sore point in a lot of families. I know way too many people who were claimed in college, despite their parents contributing nearly nothing to their education.'
b"That's especially unfair since many of those students are in precisely the kinds of jobs that are laying off."
b"Wait. So I can have no help from the Government AND no job because  one's hiring. COOL. maybe I'll just file for unemployment....wait, I can't, the system is so overloaded with the 3 million+ people applied within one week."
b'lost my job to this virus and i can\xe2\x80\x99t get a check. what\xe2\x80\x99s the fucking point then???'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m just scratching my head how somebody like me who is paying their way through college, loses their job because of the virus shutdown doesn\xe2\x80\x99t receive stimulus.  Meanwhile my grandparents who DON\xe2\x80\x99T work, drawing social security get a check...?  So those who are directly affected aren\xe2\x80\x99t helped?!?'
b'For everyone saying this is good: you do know some parents exploit their children by claiming them as dependents and then not supporting them, right?'
b'So they looked at a group of disproportionately laid off people who were already famous for being financially insecure even before coronavirus shut down their on-campus jobs, and thought \xe2\x80\x9cI will specifically exempt these people from relief checks\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Wait, at the end of the article she says that the treasury needs to provide guidance on this issue so isn't it still unresolved? As in, she is making the case that college kids might be screwed but that the treasury has yet to speak on this issue specifically. Maybe i'm trying to be hopeful here but if I don't get $1200 i at least want my parents to get $500."
b"What if you're a 24 year old who now lives and works on their own but was claimed as a dependent during tax season in early 2019?"

b'Every tax bill of every kind has a moshpit of winners and losers.'
b"It's ok, people 17-24 aren't affected by the shutdown of their schools and workplaces. They wouldn't use the money to stimulate the economy, they would probably waste it on rent or something."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 in my last semester of college. My parent don\xe2\x80\x99t pay for anything for me, I work two jobs (lost one temporarily due to covid) and live on my own. They claimed me as a dependent in 2018 but not in 2019. Will I get a check?'
b'I was laid off. I was claimed as a dependent. I\xe2\x80\x99m 20. I fucking can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this lm so livid right now. I feel like crying, fuck.'
b'I was claimed as a dependent even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve provided 90% of my own expenses in 2019. \xf0\x9f\xa4\x99 thanks mom.'
b'Just another attempt at disenfranchising college students and young voters. Nobody is seeming to mention that you HAVE to have a cosigner to take out college loans for tuition and fees as a college-aged student. Your cosigner (usually a parent) CAN THEN LEGALLY CLAIM YOU. Even if they NEVER pay a dime towards your rent, food, or the loan itself. The sheer amount of college loans is way more than half of a students "support". This is a fucking ridiculous loophole on dependency.'
b"My dad has claimed me every year for my fasfa. Gonna enjoy not being able to pay rent (in Louisiana and I'm pretty sure evictions are not banned yet)"
b'There are a lot of people who won\xe2\x80\x99t be getting these checks. Rough assumption is 35-50% won\xe2\x80\x99t be eligible for this mass stimulus bill. Not really massive for average Americans, mostly corporation.'
b'College tuition fees are not free.  This is bs.'
b'Why does America hate its own students so much, the disdain for college students is so immense'
b'This is bullshit. I have 3 jobs I just lost? I have my own actual bills to pay? I need that money :('

b'As a 20 year old dependent living on my own who just lost my job til this is all over- this sucks'
b"Well, that's fucking disgusting. Boeing gets a massive pile of money they don't fucking need while many people that do need those checks get nothing."
b"I fucking hate this shit. I'm 20 now and moved out on my own since the middle of last year, but bc I'm counted as a dependent from 2 years ago, i don't get help. Which my fast food working ass needs, as i don't see how me and my fiance can possibly pay all the bills this april."
b"Im not a college student. I worked last year and filed my 2019 taxes. I allowed my father to claim me on his 2019 taxes. Does that mean I won't be getting a stimulus check?"
b'And this is how looting starts. Everyone ahould get a check regardless of tbeir situation.'
b'Kinda dumb since the whole point of these checks is to have them spent to keep the economy moving. Who\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to spend than college students?'
b"Fuck over a mojority of your base by failing to prepare for a pandemic that they are especially vulnerable to \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nTell those same people they'll just have to suck it up and die for the sake of the economy \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nFuck over an entire generation of angry, young and desperate people between 17-25 \xe2\x9c\x94\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nI swear to god if this man somehow still wins in November (if there's even an election) because people just couldn't be bothered to vote for the other option, there is no fucking hope for humanity."

b'This makes no sense?'
b'If only there was something young people could do in the upcoming future to change these sort of things.....'
b'For some student who have lost their jobs because of this out break this is potentially devastating news. Full time students cannot claim unemployment where I live and now with this news me and my roommate (both college students) are about to lose our apartment. Maybe we are the idiots for both allowing our parents to claim us as dependents, but our parents told that was the best choice and since we both still rely on our parents for health and car insurance we just sort of went along with it. Now we are desperatly trying to find ways to either make ends meet or figure out how we will move before the first of the month. This bill was one of the greatest hopes for us. Guess not any more'

b'Question, I\xe2\x80\x99m a 25 year old graduate student and my parents claimed me as a dependent. Does this rule apply to me since I\xe2\x80\x99m not 18-24 or does it apply due to the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m a dependent? Thanks'

I would greatly appreciate a change before it leaves the senate to help out us students.\n\nThank you,'

b'This was probably intentional. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s got to work at those essential services. Now young people have to replace the workers that get sick.'
b"This demographic is most vulnerable economically because they have basically no meaningful work skill yet to market.

Or bankrupt those same kids later on in their professional lives.\n\nIt's pathetic, but hopefully now the country bumpkins voting red see beyond their safe spaces and into reality: their candidates are socioeconomical terrorists against the <=upper middle class."
b"We all get exposed to the inflation and debt from this stimulus and receive absolutely no benefit! Yay! Fuck means testing. Should have just cut a $1200 check for every single adult and $600 for every single child.

b'Lost my job this past year and have made hardly $500 a month since. Thankfully my gf can pay half rent and such with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a free lance artist and was trying to file as a dependent again with my fathers taxes, not knowing I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to file with how little income I actually made. I was happy to see even non-taxed people get this stimulus, it\xe2\x80\x99s the equivalent to two months for me at the moment. I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 and will be 25 April 8th. Three classes left this semester in college and that was the main reason I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t applicable on my fathers taxes. I know every single of my college friends claim as a dependent, not living with their parents. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t only callus to a whole generation but representably ignorant alongside the other miss appropriations this bill suggests. I\xe2\x80\x99m so angry with the republicans and the wealthy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99d wish death upon them but they\xe2\x80\x99re wishing it upon themselves with their action. If it truly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an evil to be as wealthy as a billionaire they\xe2\x80\x99d prove it. Sadly here my parents generation believe that politics relate to ones \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal truth\xe2\x80\x9d instead of factual evidence. It saddens me to see so much corruption still continue, with Bernie fighting to get his presidency. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long shot but anything is possible. :/'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s so retarded it makes me angry.\n\nWhat do they think these students are going to do? Simply starve in their house and die? F*ck off\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to look for work outside and continue spreading CV.

b'Well that sucks, you would think the parents will get the checks.'
b"Wtf?! *Those* are the ones that just lost their fucking jobs. Fuck every goddamned politician in DC - both sides. If they're too damned stupid to figure out what they just did they need to be fired this November. Un fucking believable."

b'Is there somewhere I can read about all the details regarding the checks?'
b'Im 29 and likely wont receive one.'
b'Wait ok ok so...\nIn 2018 I was dependent. \n2019 I am married and will be filing jointly... slight possibility for separately. But not going to be claimed as dependent on 2019 taxes. \nHowever, we have not done taxes yet. \nWill I get a check? I am so confused.'
b"what if i filed my taxes that i will be claimed as a dependent but my parents don't claim me as they haven't filed yet? will i still be eligible"
b'Ah yes. Just leave out some of the poorest people in this country.'
b'goood thing my parents cut me off'

b'This is a bruh moment, guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just starve'
b"Yay our government HATES college students!!! It's almost like what universities are a business???"

b"Imo This may add to the the spread of the virus. If young adults believe  1.They're not financially backed up  and 2. They're immune to the virus. This may cause young men and women to risk infection of themselves and others in order to continue to support themselves, despite the symptoms."
b'My parents combined made too much money in 2018 to qualify for the stimulus checks, but they bought a house in 2018 which took up most of their savings. After paying their employees and rent for their business there\xe2\x80\x99s almost nothing left for their mortgage. If I had been independent I could have gotten my own check but since they claimed me as a dependent none of us would have been receiving checks. We pushed through last minute on my 2019 tax returns this morning so at least one of us will be getting one. If I get it it\xe2\x80\x99s all going towards helping my parents keep their home.'
b'I marked I was a dependent on my taxes, but not one claimed me lmfao, guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this pans out'
b'Lmfao I literally have so many bills due in April and no job... I filed for unemployment but got denied because of insufficient wages because I tried school first before deciding to get a job. I heard there\xe2\x80\x99s a job that gives you a uniform of Black Air Force ones , a ski mask and a glock 19 tho 0_0'
b'And here my friends is the start of "who deserves it and who doesn\'t" bullshit. Just fucking give adults the 1200 and each child an additional 500 you fucking twats.'
b'This is not well thought through. Even when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t claim my kids, we helped support them with significant contributions and it would have fallen on us if they lost their jobs while in school. Those jobs made it all sort of work. We would have been above the 120K limit then too but we were then swamped in medical bills and covering our kids gaps. This would have been crushing for all of us but they are now completely independent and we finally paid off the tab from their medical and other expenses, at detriment to our retirement savings. It\xe2\x80\x99s gone but we are rebuilding slowly and have (had?) pensions. \nCollege students aren\xe2\x80\x99t a statically significant part of the voting populace. It\xe2\x80\x99s unethical but as long as that\xe2\x80\x99s true, they will always be the first to be dismissed by our legislatures, especially in these crisis situations. Out of sight, out of mind. Call, email, or Resistbot your representatives and tell them how this affects you. Do it repeatedly. Let their staff get to know your name. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to write mine and tell them how this would have affected my family- if we were still in debt due to supporting them. That was last year. I would have blown a gasket. These are crap times. As always, they are going to listen to who gets them elected and the voices getting their ear. The email my rep sent me last night said they are already planning/working on the next COVID-19 relief bill. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the end of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be ongoing.'

b"Bartended 3-4 nights a week wouldn't even pay a tenth of what I pay in tuition today. Also, ever fail a class? What degree? Parents help you? Unpaid internship required? Every* senior in my CS program that has a job failss, and a single fail means you're kicked out of the program. Sorry, it's not 2013 anymore.\n\nEdit: a word. Need coffee"
b'yup\n\nmy fucking parents tried to claim me when i was living with my grandparents way back lol.\n\nwell makes since generally most parents end up paying in some part for their kids education in some way or another. lol'
b"Why are people over the age of 18 letting their parents claim them? Legitimately asking. My parents made me do my own taxes since I turned 18 telling me there are somethings that you just have to do on your own. If you didn't allow them to claim you, wouldn't you qualify for Obamacare in your state and pay minimum costs?"
b"The title is misleading, it's adults of every age, not up to age 24.  If you were claimed as a dependent by anyone, you don't get a check.  This also includes an elderly parent you may have claimed as a dependent, they also don't get a check.  The idea behind this was to make sure that no one who is very poor gets a check, because most adults with very low income are claimed as a dependent by another adult."
b"I'm either getting a check or $1200 worth of shit from any corporation that's slipping enough to let me get away with it"
b'Imagine if Nancy Pelosi, instead of wasting all that time writing and arguing about that fat bill she stuffed to the gills with permanent items from the Democratic wishlist that are completely unrelated to the current crisis, actually looked at what the country needs right now and thought about that for half a minute. Maybe she would have said \xe2\x80\x9cwaaaiiitaaaaaminute! There\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly large demographic here that is going to be left out!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Is this based off of the 2019 tax year?'
b'Lmao fuck'
b'I already filed my taxes and I believe my parents claim me as a dependent. Is there anything I can do?'
b'Well that sucks. Was going to start a savings account'
b'Plus the car rental policy for them is pretty tough...'
b"I'm pretty sure I was not claimed as a dependent. I have a question I was hoping someone could answer:\n  \n  \nI didn't file in 2018, and I just today filed my 2019 taxes for a TINY amount of income I made last year. Could I qualify? I know it should take almost a month for the return to process."
b"I'm fairly positive that I don't qualify anymore.  I made less than 12k last year, so I was claimed as a dependent for a better tax return, for my understanding.\n\nSo basically, I just got fucked over."
b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a clear answer. I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 was claimed a dependent 2018 but independent 2019 do I get the check?'
b"I'm one of those lucky college students :p"
b'If I had a baby in 2019 should I file taxes asap to get the $500?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever those who came after the millennials are called.... yeah, screw em, too\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I filed as independent this year, but last year my parents claimed me. I see people are saying that I should be getting a check but my parents have yet to file this year? Would they have to file for 2019 in order for me to get the check?'
b"Its 2am. I'm gonna go to sleep and hopefully when I wake up the government will say sike"
b'Lol burn'
b"So what if I filed my taxes literally two days ago and clicked the box that said I could be claimed as a dependent but my parents haven't claimed me yet because they haven't done their 2019 taxes. I'm 23 and graduated last year. Does anyone know where I would fall in getting the check or not? I've tried looking it up, but haven't found anything definitive."
b'And why would they? If they are dependent, then they don\xe2\x80\x99t need this like actual adults do.'
b'How am I not supposed to kill myself with all this shit going on? How fucked are we, right guys?'
b'Please share my petition. I dont have the biggest outreach\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/donald-j-trump-tax-paying-dependents-receive-stimulus-package-too?original_footer_petition_id=&grid_position=&pt='
b'Nice county you have in there'
b'Can someone explain this to me? do children (minors) get factored in the amount their parents get?'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the explanation for the government essentially saying 17-24 year olds don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be fed?'
b"If I already filed my taxes as a dependent (because I didn't know any better), but I amend my return, will I eventually be able to receive the $1200 stimulus check?\n\nI technically should have filed as an independent, being that I support myself financially. My parents are about to file their taxes, and are already on board with not claiming me on their taxes."
b'I think, since I claim my significant other, we will just be receiving one check of $1200. ugh. Better than a kick in the pants I guess.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s looking like even though you didn\xe2\x80\x99t claim yourself to be a dependent on both forms you can still legally be a dependent? What the shit'
b'[deleted]'
b"It's more so if your parents claim you on their taxes. I'm 23 and normally have my mother claim me on her taxes as it lowers my tuition. I did my taxes a day or two ago and claimed independent in order to ensure I get the $1,200."
b"No. Living with your parents doesn't make you a dependent. But if you don't file your own taxes and your parents claim you as a dependent, you will not get the $1,200."
b'8'
b'I got 3 letters for the people in office: WTF'
b"Damn I was thinkinng if I was a citizen id get money but here it is, I wouldn't either way"
b'Or if you\xe2\x80\x99re a student, live on your own and work, but your parents help you out. That screws you over as well.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve made 11,000 a year as a student almost every other year but 2019. In 2019 I was in an academic (unpaid) influenza lab which is required for my graduation. Then I had a full time summer job, and health complications/a surgery that drastically cut my work hours in the fall. My paycheck didn\xe2\x80\x99t qualify me as independent. I do cover all my spring/summer costs and now I\xe2\x80\x99m facing those months unsure if I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to support myself/keep working, and with the least savings I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my entire life.'
b'17+. Not just up to 24'
b'Yeah this is the part that bothers me. It would be one thing just to say "College kids won\'t get the money, but their parents will instead." But that\'s not true. There is a non payment gap between like 18 and 24.'
b"I don't get this, nor do I understand why retired people on social security are getting checks. They haven't lost a job and taken an income hit so why?"
b'Really?? They don\xe2\x80\x99t count as a \xe2\x80\x98kid\xe2\x80\x99 for $500?'
b'Well that\xe2\x80\x99s FUCKING RETARDED. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting shafted by $500 for my most expensive kid and he got laid off from his on campus job because campus is closed and he won\xe2\x80\x99t get any financial relief.'
b'I was wondering cause I have an 18 year old claimed as a dependent last year. Oh well.'
b"I mean, at what point in all this did you think the federal government actually gives a damn about you? \n\nWas it when they disregarded the briefings 3 weeks ago so the rich could sell stocks and profit? \n\nWas it when non essential corporations stay open despite the risk to society so long as the profits keep flowing?\n\nWas it when Government called it a hoax and didn't prep our health care system with the necessities?\n\nWas it when 1.5 Trillion dollars went to Wall Street and 350 Billion to Americans, and apparently not even all of them.\n\nThe government / rich are pissed off you're not working for scraps anymore. \n\nGet back to fucking work peasant. If you die, there are still billions to replace you."
b'Well that\'s harsh. When I read the title, I was like, "That make sense. Why should they if they are a dependent?" Not sending it to the parents is crazy.'
b'Piggybacking off of top comment to highlight the situation I\xe2\x80\x99m in personally, which I think is the subset of the population in the article that is getting shafted the most here. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very concerned about this personally. I graduated in December and was partially dependent on my parents for income at that time. But I immediately got a full-time job and became financially independent. That means that even as a financially independent adult in the income bracket these checks are specifically designed to help, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get no relief despite being impacted just like everyone else. I\xe2\x80\x99m also getting no help from my parents because, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m an independent adult now. Just like they are. \n\nThis shit should not be based on last year\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances. Current W-2\xe2\x80\x99s/other forms should be used instead of tax returns that for people in my situation no longer reflect their circumstances in any way shape or form.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve contacted all three of my representatives in both chambers of Congress about this (both parties are represented) and have yet to receive a response.'
b"Hell, there's kids with *estranged parents* who still get claimed by jackasses they don't even remember.\n\n It can royally fuck with their lives."
b'As someone who has awesome parents, god damn... selfish selfish selfish'
b"That's tax evasion by the parents. You can only claim dependents if you provide most of their living expenses."
b"This sucks. I'm about to graduate and I might not be able to work. I managed my finances so that I would be able to barely support myself throughout May, but with Trump not taking this situation seriously I might be out of work with an empty bank account for the rest of the summer"
b'I mean there is a criteria for being a dependent or not and if you file your taxes and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match what your parents did than it comes dow to whether or not you actually qualify as one or not. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a \xe2\x80\x9cwell my parents filed me as a depend solely in shut out of luck\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'College kids have *been* getting screwed - this is just the latest case. You struggle so hard to make the money work in college. Free college and student debt cancelation could fix this problem *tomorrow*. Remember which candidate is willing to tackle education when you vote.'
b'> I know way too many people who were claimed in college, despite their parents contributing nearly nothing to their education.\n\nIf they aren\xe2\x80\x99t filling a tax return, does it really matter if their parents claim them on their taxes?'
b'Yep. Moved out at 18 and parents had nothing to do with my life. Still got screwed over every fucking time I had to apply for aid'
b"Curious, do you get the $500 if the kid is 17 and in high school? I know a lot of people lose a large tax break when the kids turn 17. Which is bullshit because you're still housing, feeding, and clothing them. And have you seen a 17 year old boy eat?"
b"My sister lost her job. She now gets pretty much nothing from all of this despite being in the group that this bill was intended to help.\n\nShe's entirely independent this year but was a dependent last year so she is disqualified. Fucking ridiculous."
b':('
b'The unemployment will definitely help them then... Chances are unemployment will pay more then they were making for a few months which could be far more valuable then $1200 or $500'
b"It's especially stupid as well.\n\nCollege students living at home during this will literally go and blow that 1200 dollars right away.  That's immediate, and direct stimulus.  \n\nThe rest of us will spend it on food and rent to tide us by through 1 month of unemployment.  If I lose my job, rent and food first, then consumer spending."
b"Well not really, if they're marked as dependent then that means their paycheck isn't their livelihood like others. If there's only a limited amount of stimulus checks, this makes sense."
b'The beefed up unemployment benefits would probably benefit those people more anyway (state unemployment + fed\xe2\x80\x99s $600 a week contribution for 4 months) than the stimulus payment.'
b"If they were claimed as a dependent, that means someone else is supporting them financially, so they really shouldn't be receiving the stimulus. What doesn't make any sense is that the parents supporting them won't receive anything."
b"Yes, that is me two degrees over (a BS and an MS in a field currently doing massive lay offs). Won't get a job this year, do I not deserve help because I am just the wrong age????"
b'bootstraps!!!!/s'
b"People are getting pushed thru unemployment super fast (in my state at least)  \n\n2 family members were laid off last week, filed that day, and were approved by today.  \n\nYour results may vary, but dont be all doom and gloom until it's actually gloomy(er)"
b"You still need to file. It doesn't take long and it's better than nothing."
b"don't worry! Retirees will make sure to do good with it along with their social security! :) what a joke"
b"....100% unemployment for an extended period, +$600 per week, for 4 months... 2020 taxes are not due until 2021, so unless there's some reason you would be ineligible for unemployment, or could not file independent then, you should hopefully be ok (and get that money a lot faster than you would the stimulus check anyway - sorry you got left out though. It'll be weeks before those $1200 checks start hitting direct deposit, and even longer for those who do not have direct deposit on file with the IRS).."
b'$600 extra a week in unemployment for 4 months? So $9600?'
b'[deleted]'
b'exactly so. fucking. ridiculous.....'
b'If you lost your job, you should be able to get unemployment plus up to $600 extra per week for 4 months, which amounts to far more than that $1200.'
b'Sometimes I wonder how they came up with these seemingly-arbitrary rules.  I highly doubt the lawmakers are using data to determine their decisions.'
b'Exactltly. They fucked us. The people who claimed us but more so the goverment for not understanding many people would be in this situation.'
b"I'm about to graduate college, and now the economy is completely fucked so I won't get hired anywhere. No check for me!\n\nThanks congress. Thanks a lot"
b'Why are you claimed as a dependent then?'
b"If you filed taxes this year or last year as independent then you'll get one. If you haven't, file them that way now."
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the boat I\xe2\x80\x99m in. Lost both jobs I had since I work in the service industry. Definitely fun times for me.'
b'Parents don\xe2\x80\x99t write the tax law, if you provide more than 50% of your support then file your taxes as an independent. If that is the case then the parents are the ones that have an error in their return, not the child. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need parental permission to file your taxes.'
b"Isn't that tax evasion?"
b'My mom all day every day'
b">you do know some parents exploit their children by claiming them as dependents and then not supporting them, right?\n\nHow does that work?  If the kid doesn't claim they are a dependent, wouldn't the IRS see a conflict?"
b'You do know that you can claim yourself and then the parents need to prove you qualify as a dependent though right?'
b'Yeah, but what are college kids gonna do about it? Vote? Not likely....'
b'But if you parents claimed you as a dependent then that means they financially support you no?'
b'Right? Like fuck poor people, what are they gonna do with that money? Probably hide it in offshore tax havens... Oh... Oh well shit.'
b'Sounds like a no to be honest.'
b"I read that if your situation has changed since 2019, you might be able to get the stimulus check but it won't be right away. Worth looking into."
b'If you support yourself most of the time, why were you claimed as a dependent?'
b"Then you're disqualified and will get a tax credit in 2020."
b'My exact situation. Seems we might be shit outta luck my friend'
b"I think you might see a credit in 2020. I read the actual text of the bill and it's not 100% clear. My daughter is basically in the same boat but she lives at home. Kids can't be claimed if they are 24 at any time during the tax year.\n\nThe credit is for tax year 2020 (and you will file on your own for tax year 2020) but they are essentially giving it out an advance. Since you were claimed on your parent's return in 2018/2019, you likely wont receive anything this year. However, when you file your 2020 return in 2021, you should get up to $1200 credit, depending on your tax liability. Minimum would be $600.\n\nWhat's confusing is using 2018 or 2019 tax returns. If they look at your parent's return without regard to your birthday, this may not be accurate. I imagine they will take into account the date of birth for dependents. \n\nI'm not an expert but I did read the actual text and I've been doing my own taxes for over 30 years. With the IRS, nothing is straight forward and they usually can't answer these questions!"
b'Wft? Americans can claim adults as dependents? Can someone explain this to me? It makes no sense.'
b"Back when I was a student in the UK, I tried to get a student loan as an independent at about 21 or 22 and I was refused. Despite using bank statements and housing contracts to prove that I had been financially supporting myself, the Student Loan Company informed me that I couldn't be independent until I was either 25 or legally disowned by my parents.\n\nThey assume that parents will help you. But not all parents do. It was infuriating and demeaning."
b'No check, but a tax credit next year for the amount.'
b'All depends on whether they have filed their 2019 return.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the new law, the IRS is going to look first to your 2019 tax return to compute the payment. If no 2019 return has been filed, however, the IRS will grab your 2018 return instead.\xe2\x80\x9d  For more details see:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2020/03/26/when-you-file-your-2019-tax-return-will-impact-your-stimulus-payment/#760cbb8db9dc'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m actually glad I graduate next semester and not this one I feel your pain I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry'
b"I'm not saying this to diminish how much this sucks for you or your generation, in fact the opposite: this is what happened to people graduating in in 2008 & 2009. They graduated into total garbage economy, and paid for it *for years*. So, get ready for NOT getting a bailout."
b'They can cut you a check if you\xe2\x80\x99re not a dependent.'
b'If a job offer was rescinded due to covid, I think you can file for unemployment now'
b"I graduated during the prior recession so I'm really sympathetic to what's going on with all these kids graduating college right now.  \n\nAs soon as we're out of self isolation I plan on trying to hire 2-3 people from that group if I can find them.  Even if they don't plan on staying with me long."
b'As a 2008 college grad, I feel for you.  I now make plenty of money and fully support increasing safety nets even when it means people like myself have to pay significantly higher taxes.'
b"Thank you! Most people here seem to be limiting this to 17-24 for some reason but there's a ton of elderly that can't get social security that are being taken care of by their kids that are getting nothing."
b"If poor people and young people didn't want to be losers they should have hired better lobbyists."
b"That's why it should just be a flat 600 biweekly for everyone making an income. Higher income brackets will pay almost half of it back in taxes anyway."
b'i\xe2\x80\x99m guessing you\xe2\x80\x99re meaning that sarcastically but i\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that argument made unironically.'
b'Did you file 2019 taxes independently already? \nIf they have your 2019 taxes where you aren\xe2\x80\x99t being claimed by your parents, you will get a check.\nIf you haven\xe2\x80\x99t filed and they only have you for 2018, then no, since your parents claimed you then.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in almost the same boat. Only getting 3 hrs of work per week. Message me if you want to talk. Livid is the word for describing my emotions too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same boat as you. This is a huge oversight. I cried all of last night, this is incredibly unjust and you aren\xe2\x80\x99t alone.'
b"I might be in the same boat. I feel you. I'm so sorry. =("
b'will you be able to file unemployment?  If so, there is suppose to be an additional 600 per week payment on unemployment if you qualify, for up to 4 months.'
b"She can't legally do that. So like the other poster said, you should go ahead and file as independent. The tell her. She can file an amended return. \n\nIt's silly for her to take the $500 credit she gets, when you could get the $1500 check. \n\nBut best to file right away electronically. Not sure when the cutoff is for having your filing done for 2019 to get the check. If you haven't filed, they look at 2018 data."

b'AND college students can\xe2\x80\x99t get financial aid based on their own finances until age 25 whether or not they are claimed as dependents and whether or not they pay for everything on their own. (at least in CA)'

b'Losing a job might be a blessing. Working a "required" job will actually pay *less* than claiming unemployment. Also being over 17 so my mom doesn\'t get the 500.

b"They can't claim you as a dependent if you're 25. Since you're right on the line it comes down to your birthday or how much you made the past couple of years.

It has less to do with age than it does with income and filing status.\n\nLots of problems with this, but unfortunately that's how these things tend to go."
b'then you\xe2\x80\x99re independent and should file your taxes and get the check'
b'Then you should be filing as independent and getting a check.'
b"I thought someone had to support 50% of their child's expenses to claim them as a dependent?"
b"there's unfortunately more boomers in this world...hence joe biden"
b"If you aren't a dependent then you should be doing your taxes and filing as an independent. The IRS will notice you are claimed twice and ask for proof you are independent.\n\nIf you aren't actually independent well... then the bill does as intended."
b'?'
b'You should probably do your taxes ASAP. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t filed for 2019 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be based off of 2018'
b"The problem is that 1, some of them are actually independents who have filed as dependents, and 2, even if they're truly dependents, their parents will not receive an extra $500 because they're older than 17"
b"A lot of time parents will claim their adult kids as dependants without consulting them. It can be from lack of communication, but it's very common for abusive families to do that to their kids to screw them over/force them to be financially dependant on them."
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re students and insurance purposes'
b'since my parents pay for my college they claim me'
b'In my case, I claim my 19 and 20 yr olds because they are living in my house and not paying for a thing. (Sore subject and one that has been discussed at length with both of them) This completely blows.... they cost me more now than when they were 10 & 11 and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get the 500 and they can\xe2\x80\x99t get the 1200? And I won\xe2\x80\x99t get the 500 for my 17 yr old junior in high school?! \n\nDid not sign up to be a poor single mother, but at least I am at a job that I can work from home and stay safe. Count the blessings, I guess.'
b'Yea this makes no sense to me. In Canada the cutoff is 18. Why the fuck is an adult able to be a dependent?'
b'but what about abortions?! \n\n/s \n\ni hate literally everyone running this country right now'
b'I doubt, because the deadline got extended to mid july.'
b'You should, I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the reason they moved the deadline up'
b'same situation and same question here!'
b'Yes! I had my son on December 31st, 2019 and since we happened to file our 2019 taxes in February he counts towards the stimulus check.'
b'No as long as you filed 2019 independent and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t put you as dependent this year'
b"I'm in the same spot as you, so I hope that because I wasn't claimed I may get a check. Though I am doubtful."
b'If someone is providing more than 50%  of your income, you are dependent on them, financially speaking.\n\nIf you have dependents, you get tax breaks.'
b"Question. Are you not filing your own tax return? If you live on your own and pay for your own things why are you not filing a tax return for yourself? What is your income to pay for these things if you're not filing a tax return?\n\nEdit: And the comment is deleted..."
b'You do realize that if she already claimed you it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get your return denied and flagged and you get to deal with an IRS mess?'
b"I might be wrong, but I remember reading that the stimulus would be using 2018 tax returns to determine eligibility, so filing as independent for this year wouldn't change this? I'm a 21 year old college student and my dad has been claiming me as a dependent so I would love to be wrong."
b'That won\xe2\x80\x99t count. They are using 2018 taxes because the 2019 taxes aren\xe2\x80\x99t filed and completed. Stuff like this, they always go back a year.\n\nEdit: never mind, I just read more details, and if you filed your 2019, they will use that'
b'How does that lower your tuition?'
b'As the parent of 17 and 18-year-old high school kids, it sucks.'
b'Im kinda pissed about this. I may be a college dependent but i still work during the summer for my spending money. Because of Coronavirus my summer internship and job chances are pretty much gone'
b'It sucks. I hope all these 18-24 remember this shit and go vote in November. We need fresh blood and people who are empathetic and want to serve the people.'
b'> There is a non payment gap between like 18 and 24.\n\nThe very group that could change this nations leadership. Huh.'
b'High cost of living and the educated are purposefully excluded from getting help. People who tend to not vote a certain way. Not suspicious at all.'
b'They vote.'
b'Because, unlike 18-24 year olds, they vote.'
b'I read your comment to my dad and he was pissed lol'
b'How else will they afford toilet paper hoarding everyday? Have a heart!'
b"Plenty of people who are getting checks won't miss one pay check. Postal workers, Teachers, Amazon workers. \n\nAnd there are people who don't have a job anymore who won't get a check because last year they made some money. \n\nIt's a political move, buying votes. If not they could just focus on unemployment and underemployment safety nets."
b"why shouldn't they get a check?  what if they were barely able to make ends meet and had planned on getting a job before the virus hit?  would you prefer they go out and work at age 70 and gamble with a 1 in 8 chance of dying?  why shouldn't *every* adult get a check?  seniors on social security are often extremely poor, relying on barely over $1,000 a month to survive."
b'Nope. No dependent over 16.'
b'If he got laid off his campus job he should be able to collect unemployment, and the normal "waiting week" is waived and I believe that most states are also waiving the minimum work weeks normally required, and some states have also increased the benefits amounts significantly! \n\nIf he hasn\'t filed for unemployment, he should do so immediately.'
b'Yep same here. My daughter depended on her work study job to pay her car insurance and such and now that\xe2\x80\x99s gone.'
b'Can he get unemployment?'
b'Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s dumb.'
b'The higher socioeconomic statuses in the private sector are the real boogeyman here, they funnel money into the public sector to control what gets passed in the senate/house. The reality is we have an unhinged private sector that is holding the pseudo sector hostage and controls aspects of the news/media to propel propaganda to the public so we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on fully. The notion of free speech we have in this country is misleading because ideas with money behind them are heard most but ideas that lack money behind them are repressed. Who would\xe2\x80\x99ve thought that a system created by the upper class without middle class/lower class representation would\xe2\x80\x99ve only served the upper class?\n\nThe American political system is a sham to distract the American public that the same hierarchies and power structures from feudalism have once again manifested themselves into our society. The only reason the upper class is giving out money now is because they expect things to get bad and don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to revolutionize against them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a period of appeasement to the lower classes as I call it.'
b"I'm \\~90% sure they can just claim themselves. They may need to file on paper if their parents already claimed them. Then the IRS will flag the discrepancy and ask for an explanation. The parents will be the ones responsible for filing incorrectly."
b"Send your parents extra love. I'm so jealous of people who have good parents."
b'Defined by IRS as at least 51% of living expenses.'
b'I feel you, the interviews I had lined up have cancelled/postponed, so I hope my parents are fine with me living with them for the near future'
b'If she got laid off, she can get unemployment plus $600 per week for 4 months.'
b"If she has already filed her 2019 taxes she'll be fine. 2018 is only being used if 2019 hasnt been filed. If not, she'll get it next year when she files and claims the 2020 tax credit.\n\nSource: the cpa firm I work for"
b"Yeah I don't mean to be a hater but unemployment is what she needs, not some $1200 check"
b'I hope she filed for unemployment, like 2 weeks ago.'
b'Another poster mentioned that if she filed 2019 tax return as independent she will get it.'
b"> She's entirely independent this year\n\nif she files this year she should get a check right?"
b"Sadly $1200 often isn't even one month's rent for a one bedroom apartment in California. It slows the bleeding a little but it's a drop in the bucket unless this becomes a recurring payment"
b'I, a college student living at home, would have literally put it all directly into my savings account and spent some of it on CERT tests.'
b'Oh so you speak for all college students?'
b'College Student living at home, at least $1000 of that would go straight to the bank. Probably donate $100 and then buy some weed with the last $100.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, a lot of kids are in dicey financial situations at home and would probably contribute it to their family spending in general since, at this point, poor families really need to stick together and pool in their finances as a unit. \n\nAlso, a LOT of kids are on work study and have been laid off. This was money used for groceries and other things, and I doubt that going home would shift that need for necessities. \n\nMy family desperately needs the money but my I\xe2\x80\x99m 20 and my brother is 22, we\xe2\x80\x99re both college students and neither of us made enough to file taxes through the school year. We\xe2\x80\x99re literally adding nothing to our family\xe2\x80\x99s already crippled finance so this sucks majorly. I\xe2\x80\x99m applying to a bunch of scholarships so hopefully I get some so we don\xe2\x80\x99t go hungry. \n\nAlso, how exactly would we blow that money? Nothing is open, and a lot of non-essential things on Amazon are unavailable. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to spend the money on tbh apart from essentials.'
b"LOL I had a work study job where I made a whopping $80 a week. My school shut down but since I had a work study job I cannot claim unemployment even though there is no way I can work right now unless I wanted to get a grocery store job.\n\nHowever, I don't want a grocery store job because my mom's restaurant is doing very well with take out so she is still working by some miracle. If I got a job at my local grocery story for a shit wage to then end up getting infected, which means I get her infected, then I would never forgive myself.\n\nPeople in my position are told to fuck off by the government yet again."
b"The problem is we have a gap population in there. I graduated college in 2018. I was claimed as a dependent because my parents were paying for my living expenses and tuition. \n\nIt's now 2020 and I'm entirely self sufficient and graduated, but they're going off older tax returns. I get that that's likely the best way to do it, but it frankly sucks for those in my age group who are going through transitional time. I could really use that check right now."
b"I didn't get approved. My state is only offering within a small threshold. You made too little or too much? Sucks to be you. So I don't get unemployment. Plus the stimulus check doesn't apply to my situation either. So my son and I are relying on the only person who didn't get laid off in the family for support. 7 mouths to feed under one roof with one paycheck. Not enough savings to survive more than a couple of months and that's only if no other emergency takes place during this time. What luck."
b'not just better than nothing, its $600 a week plus whatever your state gives\n\nthats more than I ever had as a college student'
b'Nah, hed much rather just complain that the system doesnt work even though he never tried.'
b'Give it a month or two and collect your inheritance.'
b'I am beyond pissed off right now. Fucking burn everything something needs to change'
b'The Revolution has to start at some point'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s too late for me lads.  I hope as many of you are able to change your filing from this news.'
b'Knew nothing about taxes due to ya know.. Taxes not really being taught. Let my family claim me now im screwed. Nevertheless this was a learning experience.'
b'If you had two jobs, why are you letting your parents claim you as a dependent? File taxes yourself.\n\nAlso, you can dispute this with the IRS and say somebody mistakenly/fraudulently claimed you as a dependent and still file yourself, and they will make your parents file an amended return.'
b'So many people in this thread have no idea how taxes and filing works. It\xe2\x80\x99s scary... \nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about OP not you btw'
b'Because the rule concerns people aged 18-23 who are full-time students, many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t file returns. College students that do file returns usually don\xe2\x80\x99t make enough income for the distinction between filing as a dependent and filing as single to matter. So when mom or dad calls and says \xe2\x80\x9chey just go ahead and file as a dependent so I can get an extra thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x9d many of them are happy to. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna cause a little more friction this year because the stakes are pretty similar for both parent and child.\n\nAlso to be clear, the parents and children usually maintain a friendly familial relationship. The students are not kicked out of the house or anything and usually come home during breaks. They may even still live there full time. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that the students are paying most of their expenses themselves (like tuition) through student loans.'
b"Yea, if they hear this and don't go out and start participating, then nothing but time will get to them."
b'LMAO TRUE'
b'sometimes, lots of students get claimed even though their parents give them nothing to support them or help with college, and you can still be poor and laid off and need the relief check either way'
b'What about in 2019? I got claimed as a dependent in 2018 but not 2019'
b'Because they were dependent last year but are now independent.'
b'Will get a tax credit in 2021 for the 2020 tax return.\n\nWill be disqualified from getting the tax credit in 2020 for the 2020 tax return.'
b'You can claim an adult as a dependent if they literally depend on you to finance their life, like a college-aged child you\xe2\x80\x99re supporting with room and board or an elderly parent you take care of. Every person is entitled to deducting certain expenses from their taxes, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re financing the majority of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s expense you get their deductions.\n\nThe specifics are more complicated but that\xe2\x80\x99s the general idea.'
b'My kids are both disabled.'
b"There are parents who pay for their child's college educations, rent and food all through college. Why wouldn't those parents be able to claim them as dependents?"
b'>I\xe2\x80\x99m actually glad I graduate next semester and not this one I feel your pain I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\n\nPretty sure this is going to be around in another semester.'
b'I still have my job offer, but I know they could pull it at anytime. The anxiety of it all sucks. I hate that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to say goodbye to my friends. thanks for looking out'
b"That was my age group.  It's also why I'm going to try to specifically hire recent college grads or current college students when this calms down."
b'This is not the same as graduating in 2008 or 2009. They had graduations. They got to say goodbye to their classmates and professors since they actually knew when they were leaving. And yes, they did enter economic garbage, but we are instead entering massive economic garbage that has no future of looking any better any time soon with a side of fear that our parents, grandparents and ourselves may die.\n\nEdit: In no way am I trying to insinuate that college students are the worst off in this time. I am extremely grateful to be able to live with my parents since my college shut down and not have much in terms of bills to pay. I am also thankful that, although I am terrified, I am not as scared for my own health as I am for those around me. There are so many people who will lose much more in this time, including their income, businesses, or even lives. I only posted this comment because I think that the constant comparisons I have seen on reddit and social media of my graduating class of 2020 to the graduates of the 2008 recession are completely unfair. This is so different.'
b"Graduated in the fall of 2007. It took years for me to launch a career, but I still scraped by with part time jobs, living at home for a little while, then living with friends. I think this crisis has the potential to be far worse because I just don't see these options being readily available anytime soon. The scale of this is massive. \n\nAND - I also didn't qualify for that Bush stimulus check in 2008 either. I don't remember exactly why, but I think it was because of similar circumstances where I had just graduated, could still be claimed as a dependent, etc.  History repeats."
b'Graduated in 2009... In grad school now after 10 years recovering financially and emotionally. \n\nCool.\n\n\nCool. Cool. Cool.'
b'[removed]'
b"Yep, they should've just put all that money into outbribing the corporate world"
b'Yes. Made sure they did not claim me this year. I just keep seeing that they are using the 2018 tax year instead of 2019, depending on where I look. I want the powers that be to use 2019 over 2018 lol.'
b'keep strong kid... sorry'
b'Same but I only got one shift last week, this week I was lucky to get two since someone called out sick.'
b'Mom\xe2\x80\x99s not getting the 500 credit either.'
b'My mom saves more than 1200 by claiming me as a dependent'
b'So I was claimed unknowingly this years tax return but I have yet to file for this year. I filed independent and no one claimed me last tax year. I should get the check correct? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t of even been claimed this year and I\xe2\x80\x99ll end up filing independent regardless'
b'That was the most frustrating part for me as an under 25 student, and I am happy I put off my BS degree until after 25.'
b'America very literally hates the poor to such an extent that the middle class will completely fuck itself over just to keep the working class beneath them.\n\nNo other country passing stimulus bills are making these outrageous stipulations. I sincerely want to see this country crumble in the aftermath of this crisis.'
b'If we, as a nation, bail out an industry we should nationalize it.'
b"I would say they don't need it. They said if it came with too many provisions they would refuse it."
b'this is pretty embarrassing but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never filed my taxes before. what\xe2\x80\x99s the best place to learn how?'
b'I just realized that I would make more on unemployment.'
b'Wow....thanks America. I personally don\'t "need" this check as I\'m still living with my parents, but i was going to spend it on supplies we all needed (as I feer at some point we will follow italy in keeping everyone indoors) and then obviously have some saved for a very very rainy day.\n\nTo know that many young Americans who actually hoped and prayed for this to be a real thing a few weeks ago and who desperately needed it aren\'t going to get anything breaks my heart. I saw an r/pan yesterday where a guy was complaining about not being able to pay his rent, and then the community started giving him money through his PayPal account (most notably a guy named Ben). \n\nI fear this is how many young Americans will be able to pay their bills. This is just crazy.'
b'Have they bailed out our casinos yet? Those cultural institutions?'
b'I read we aren\xe2\x80\x99t bailing out the cruise lines..'
b"Age is irrelevant. If you're a dependent, you get nothing. It's bullshit"
b'They do.  These parents are the ones who screwed their children, not the government.'
b"Alright the second part sucks. The first just means they've taken full legal advantage of the way the tax system works."
b'That does make sense. Especially when our parents generation is the generation of helicopter parents.'
b'Happened to me!'
b"Because if you haven't filed (thought there wasn't going to be a global pandemic, haven't received documents, etc) this is based on 2018. It's March 2020. My youngest sister was in high school in 2018, parents claimed her. Now she lives on her own and is out of a job because restaurants closed, but our parents will be receiving her check. Thats why. She graduated 2 years ago but that's when its based.\n\nNot only that, but you can be claimed as a dependent if you're in college until you're 24. It's not like everyone complaining is in high school, it's a lot of college kids that let their parents get a deduction on their tax return another 5 years, because it's not like they get extra points for filing separately. These are the same kids who are out of their restaurant jobs, college jobs, etc and are still expected to pay rent.\n\n\nAnyways, doesn't matter. If you claimed a dependent or are 18-24, you or your parents won't be getting anything. They excluded that age group."
b'This is correct, but it\xe2\x80\x99s even a little worse than you describe. Since OP\xe2\x80\x99s mother already filed, OP\xe2\x80\x99s return won\xe2\x80\x99t be denied, but their mother\xe2\x80\x99s will get flagged by the IRS in a few months whenever they run a computer batch. Then she\xe2\x80\x99ll get a letter asking her to prove the dependent. If it were the other way around, OP\xe2\x80\x99s return would just get simply denied. This is one of the easiest things for them to audit since a computer program can select everyone who does this in a minute and then mail them a letter.\n\nSource: am CPA'
b'She didn\xe2\x80\x99t claim me. Already asked her.'
b"2018 tax returns if 2019 taxes aren't filed yet. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\n\nAsk your dad whether he has done his taxes this year, and if he has not, ask him to not claim you.\n\nEdit: Stop dm\xe2\x80\x99ing me tax questions. I am not a tax professional. Just a random guy on reddit who reads the news. This stuff is more nuanced than I am (honestly) qualified to answer. Everything I know can be found via Google. Disabling inbox replies."
b"The only reason they are talking about 2018 is to gain your direct deposit information. Technically this is a tax credit for 2020 so if you don't get a check and think you were eligible you can debate that on 2020 taxes when you file."
b"Do 17-18 year olds not cost money? Lmao, that's ridiculous. When I was that age I think I cost my parents more money than ever."
b"i'm sure they don't eat much or anything."
b'Same.'
b'My 17 year old does so much to keep our family afloat between watching his younger siblings while his parents work, being a live in tutor for all of their classes, and a valued voice in the general direction of our household and then being squeezed out just because he fell between the age of 16 and 18.  Seems so asinine.'
b'Damn that\xe2\x80\x99s rough. I remember getting a check from W back in 2008 for a few hundred bucks and it made my summer. It literally bridges me from living at home to getting a job. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need much back then and it was glorious'
b'Yuppp I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same boat brother and this ship is sinking fast. I\xe2\x80\x99m broke as hell rn and won\xe2\x80\x99t get any money until summer 2021 now'
b'Well to be devils advocate here, you only work on the side for a little spending money and still rely on parents. This stimulus is for people who are completely dependent and got to pay a mortgage bills like electric and water this month. You parents where able to get way more tax deductions on there credit and get higher tax return than my parents simply because I chose to not go to college and you chose to go to college. The tax code is written to give huge advantages through tax credits and tax deductions  to college students and not people like me the same age  as those college students who chose to go straight into the work force and skip college. Now that its flipped college students who are dependent on parents are now mad that there not getting any stimulus checks.'
b'They don\xe2\x80\x99t vote'
b'We have a winner'
b'And the college students who do vote tend to skew not Republican. (As well as HCOL, which was also excluded.)'
b'Most importantly they vote for the guy who\'s "handling" this.'
b"Both my parent's retirement monthly income exceed my monthly take home by 20% or more. And I make more than double that figure.  Alot of boomers retired more comfortably than their working adult children."
b"It's not that they shouldn't, but if people 17-24, who are claimed as dependents don't get one why should they? \n\n>In July 2019, there were 21.2 million employed 16- to 24-year-olds. [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/youth.nr0.htm]\n\nAnd [here](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02024942) you'll see that as of February 2020, there were 2.068 million people 75 and older who were working. \n\nMore youth will need it than elders. Especially since we are almost certainly entering a recession. The zoomers are going to come of age in a time of little work and little money and our government has decided to fuck us before it begins."
b"I claimed my dad as a dependent. He's on social security disability. I think this means I don't get the $500.00, but he will get the $1,200.00?\n\nThat part, for me, makes sense. For college students, it sucks."
b'Wow. Do you know the rationale behind that?'
b'My kid turns 16 in July.  Lucky me.'
b'I work at my colleges sport complex / event center. And I am out of work for the remainder of the semester. However, I was just about to return to seasonal job it starts in March and runs through November. This job also will not be opening though. Any advice becuase I\xe2\x80\x99m also not getting a check bc my mother claimed me.'
b'If she was dependent on her job for her expenses, you should have been telling her to file her own taxes.'
b"I'm 100% sure because I did exactly this in college. My dad had to file an amended return without me claimed on there, and then send the IRS a check for the difference. They waived any fees because it was a mistake but if they determined this was done purposefully, they can issue fines and even criminal charges."
b"This right here.  If you weren't supported, you should file on your own.  Let the parents get audited and have the chips fall where they may."

b'Wait what? CA gives $450 a week, so thatd be $1050 a week?! $4200 a month to be unemployed? Can that be right?'
b'A lot of people do not qualify for unemployment.'
b'Well not sure if I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding correctly but think he\xe2\x80\x99s saying she was dependent for the 2019 tax year'
b'SO are you saying that if someone was claimed as a dependent this year ( for 2019 tax year) and will not get the stimulus check now, then when they file their taxes in 2021 (for 2020) then they would get the credot (money) then, as long as they are not claimed as a dependent then?'
b"She needs both. \n\nWhat's the point of the $1200 check if it doesn't include people who lost their jobs and just became independent from their parents?"
b"This is not true. If you filed your 2019 taxes as an independent, you will get the check. They only use 2018 taxes if they don't have your 2019 ones."
b'You need to re-file. If you \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t get approved\xe2\x80\x9d for your regular unemployment benefit do you still get the $600 on top.'
b"Too little to claim unemployment or too much? I've never heard of that, the amount is a sliding scale based off % of what you made up to a set maximum. I've never heard of being denied that for not earning enough, unless you mean it's off the books work, or didn't have a job long enough to qualify?  \n\nAnd I mean 7 mouths to feed on 1 pay is your own doing.

b"Ok, so then don't get claimed by your parents then. There comes a point where you need to develop a certain amount of personal responsibility."
b'Sounds like you need to talk to a tax person about how your parents are illegally claiming you as a dependent. And hopefully you can see your check. And I hope this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come off at rude but amazon and a lot of grocery stores are hiring right now if you need some extra cash.\n\n\nEdit: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have no pre existing conditions of course!! I wish you the best.'
b'Should go off 2019 in your case.'
b'If BOTH you and  your parents have already filed your 2019 returns you should probably receive a check.  For more details see:\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2020/03/26/when-you-file-your-2019-tax-return-will-impact-your-stimulus-payment/#760cbb8db9dc'
b'You and your parents need to file 2019 taxes ASAP then, make sure they do not claim you'
b"Yeah my brother is in his 30s but still lives with my dad, so I guess he's not getting a stimulus check if I'm understanding this"
b'One semester? Try one year'
b"It'll be around, sure, but do you really think the world is still going to be at a standstill like this in mid-December?"
b'Yea man I fell you I was cool with a bunch of people this semester one day to the next it\xe2\x80\x99s poof I\xe2\x80\x99m never gonna see them again. Countless people dropped all their classes cause zoom calls are stupid'
b'Please hire me......\n\nI am an aspiring data analyst. I can PM you my resume'
b"It's actually traumatic. I still can't fully process how much my entire life and future have changed in the last 2 weeks."
b'As someone who graduated in 2008 I agree. Wishing the best to this year.'
b"yep the end was sudden. Lot of people I'll probably never see again and I didn't get to say goodbye"
b">Or, ya know, voted\n\nShould've just left it at that."
b"This bill defaults to use 2019 returns and only use 2018 if the latest isn't available"
b'You should be good in this case'
b'No, but likely got some form of credit on her taxes, that\'s why people want to claim dependents, so they "get more back" on their tax return.  \n\nShe likely did it before the $500 was even a thing.'
b"I'm not positive, but I think she already got a $500 credit on her return for listing you as a dependent. I an not CPA. Best to check."
b'Hope people remember this when November comes around.'
b'You may very well get your wish.'
b"Don't be embarrassed! Everyone starts somewhere. /r/tax maybe"
b"The tax software does all the work for you at this point.  If you make under a certain amount you'll be able to file for free.\n\nYou probably just need your W2s (employment records) from work and possibly your 1098t(scholarship and grant records) from your school."
b'yeah its a flaw some republicans were upset about'
b'If you \xe2\x80\x9cneed\xe2\x80\x9c the check because  you were laid off or had reduced hours or pay you get your money via unemployment.  And that will be at least $2400 per month for the next four months'
b"Kinda. They mentioned a loan. It's unlikely they got a loan without their parents and that generally requires being a dependent."
b'Oh? Same hat! My godawful mom continues to claim me as a dependent despite the fact I havent lived with her for 3 years and she hasnt supported me financially at all since then. Nice tax fraud, mom'
b'The deadline to file was just pushed back too.'
b"That's likely going to cost them much more than 1200 lol"
b"That'll cost dad more than it will net you."
b'What does "yet" mean? If I finish up my taxes and file then tomorrow am I good?\n\nI think I was claimed as a dependent in 2018 but am no longer one having graduated.'
b"is it known when we would actually receive the $1,200? I am eligible by all criteria I've read, and am one of the many rather desperate for some cash due to reduced work/basically losing my job."
b"Isn't the $2500 dependent amount saved on taxes worth more than $1200?"
b'I am in the same situation. If I ask my parents to not claim me as a dependent, do I need to file my taxes to get the $1200? My income is under the threshold at which filing is required.'
b'Will you do my taxes?'
b'I responded to another guy too. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get to pick whether you want to be a dependent or not. There are a set of criteria you have to meet to be someone\xe2\x80\x99s dependent and if you meet them you definitely are a dependent. There is not any choice involved only judgement.'
b'My poor dad agreed to pay for my car insurance before doing any pricing research. He had been accident free for 40 years and I think the sticker shock turned more of his hair grey.'
b'Almost as bad as what age Disney considers child ticket.'
b"Welcome to the great generation gap in tax policy.\n\nTax codes first written in the 1950s, were  based on historically abberant demographic trends.  These include age at first marriage, age at household formation, and to an extent age at entering the full time work force.\n\nIt's unsurprising then, that despite  a return to a more historical age at first marriage and household formation, as well as  massive shift in the education/training required to enter full time workforce, that  17/18 year olds are excluded from being part of parents household"
b'Mine is home from college eating us out of house and home.'
b"Unreal.  They're just actively fucking daring us to revolt on them right now... that's really the only way to put it.\n\n'How fucking far can we push these fucking marks before they snap back and injure us?  How much shit can we just force them to swallow before they spit it back in our faces?  Here, let's try this... I bet they don't do shit and just take it.'"
b"Sure some parents can afford it, but there's a good chuck of 17-18 year olds who are working part-time (less than $12.2k) to help their families make ends meet, and if they're claimed as a dependent during a work shutdown?  Fuck."
b'When I was that age I ran away from home got a job in a machine shop and moved in with my youth group leader from church who was 10 yrs older than me.'
b"Let's be clear, this bill was about giving enough to the working class to call it a win, but not enough for it to actually to be win. Keep in mind the corps (who make millions to billions in profit a year) get a 450 billion dollar fund that can be leveraged 10x (for 4.5 trillion) but if you made more then 90k individually or 190 as a couple you get Jack shit aside from a lecture on how you should have saved more.\n\nAll Republicans, from the voters to the officials, are fucking ghouls."
b'Nope, beans and rice and rice and beans.'
b'Remember this in November folks.'
b'I said it earlier, but I lost because why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?'
b"That's funny. In your case you will get the $120[ but nothing for dad. OR they may pay you $1200 and if they don't catch on to you claiming dad he might get the $1200 too. You are only disqualified from getting the stimulus if you are claimed on someone else's taxes."
b'No that would be incorrect. If you took a section 151 deduction for an individual that individual is ineligible to receive a rebate.'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re using existing tax statutes for child tax credits.'
b'On the bright side, maybe this will open parents eyes & they\xe2\x80\x99ll stop claiming kids they don\xe2\x80\x99t fully support who are in college \xe2\x80\x94 so that their kids can actually get decent financial aide packages for college...'
b"Bingo. Funny how many people are getting angry at the government and/or their parents. If you're truly independent... file your own taxes. I was doing it at 18, because I truly was independent then."
b'Indeed.  NC is my home state and I once tried to file unemployment there.  They did everything in their power to deny, including multiple appeals.    The way they saw it \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re young.. go work\xe2\x80\x9d.    \n\nGood luck'
b'$450 a week max, but yeah thats gonna be pretty common given wages in california\n\nedit: to be clear I\xe2\x80\x99m saying $450 in max benefits from california, there\xe2\x80\x99s also the $600 per month in automatic federal benefits, but california\xe2\x80\x99s scale to an extent with your income\n\nits your quarterly income divided by 26 iirc'
b'gig workers and freelancers qualify under this bill(thanks Bennet)'
b'Yes, the check being sent out is being called an "advance rebate" that will offset the 2020 tax credit'
b"So my parents claimed me as a dependent in 2018. I just filed my 2019 today as an independent. My parents haven't done their taxes yet and plan for the gov to use their 2018 taxes. Do I qualify?"
b'Just adding that this does happen. Here in Ohio you can be denied on too much or too little. Basically you are screwed at Ohio minimum wage under 30 hours earning too little. It is insulting. That is why there are people wanting their workplace open because they get no income otherwise.'
b"I know it sounds odd. I read the paperwork twice. I don't make enough to qualify. I work part-time. I wasn't laid off and the job is closed due to the virus at least until the summer. My work said all staff was guaranteed it but that wasn't the case. The only staff members who were approved were in a different department. I've been working there for over half a decade.\n\nMy family is 5 people and 2 dogs. Mom and Dad both had jobs. Mom was injured at work by a coworker to the point of becoming permanently disabled. She's been home for the past few years in pain with no disability payments. \n\nMy sister just got laid off a couple of days ago. She's been actively applying for jobs, but no one is hiring in our small town because everything is closed. Her puppy has a liver disorder that comes with a lot of excess fees in medication, appointments and specialty food. Our other dog is in good health. \n\nAnd finally, I'm out of work but not laid off. My son relies on a paycheck I may not receive until June or July. I'm homeschooling him. My town has no emergency daycare setup. My family refuses to babysit anymore because he has a disorder and medication is not helping him at all. \n\nI'm not the only one suffering and I know that, but compassion goes a long way. We did not choose for my Mother to get attacked at her job one day, we did not choose for a virus to knock two of us out of work and I'm not going to blame two innocent dogs or a young child for our current financial burdens. We didn't suddenly all wake up, quit our jobs and beg for freebies. Most of life just happens and isn't in our control."
b'california denies for not earning enough in a period'
b"I mean... They're not wrong are they..."
b'Because when people can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay bills, bad things start happening \n\nThis whole pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camels back'
b'This.'
b"THANK YOU for this. I've been trying to find decent information on whether 2019 will be counted first. Definitely helps me that it will."
b"I'm like OP of the comment you replied to, claimed in 2018 but not 2019. I'm not sure if my mom filed her 2019 returns but I did. What does it matter if she didn't but I did?"
b'Any idea how the IRS would approach this if you filed jointly in 2018, got divorced in 2019, and only one of you has filed for 2019? I have no clue if my ex husband has filed his taxes yet.'
b'Why would your parents need to file their 2019?  \nIn 2018 I was claimed on my parent\xe2\x80\x99s taxes as a dependent, but this year I claimed myself and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t filed yet. I have already received my tax return, and according to everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far, this would mean I receive the $1200 stimulus check.'
b'My entire short term life plan just changed, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to say goodbye to most of the people that made the past 4 years of my life special. This is a really scary time, and it still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really hit me. For the foreseeable future, locked in my house with my parents with no way to generate income. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a job because I\xe2\x80\x99d be risking their lives if I get the virus.'
b"... didn't young people actually vote in line with their % of the voting age population?"
b'Voting is a limited source of creating accountability. It is easy to use this as a cudgel but their is plenty of political science research out there showing that business based interest groups control the real levers of power in government despite having a tiny minority of actual votes.'
b'What if I filed 12 hours ago'
b'Nope, no funds for any dependent over 16.'
b'I can 100% assure electoral justice is impossible in the United States.'
b'Are you claiming independent? No one else can claim you. The irs will take her refund the next cycle if she does do it. The operating system they have is updated to catch these issues.'
b"That's true, but depending on how things go, there might wind up being more than one check coming to us."
b"I'd say you'd be good filing tomorrow. It's going to be a while before they're cutting checks."
b"I was wondering the same thing. I'll just hope for the best send file my taxes this weekend"
b'It seems it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be awhile. Probably late April if we are lucky. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be wrong though.'
b'Right now they\xe2\x80\x99re saying in three weeks, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got automatic deposits to your bank set up with the IRS. If the IRS deposits your tax refund directly into your bank account, you\xe2\x80\x99re good to go. If you receive your refund in the form of a paper check, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your next step is.'
b'In NY, not sure if other states are different, you get $500 for \xe2\x80\x9cother dependents\xe2\x80\x9d so if a college student is 18-24 you\xe2\x80\x99re only saving $500 vs $2000 if they\xe2\x80\x99re below 18 iirc from my tax class. Could be wrong, not a tax expert'
b'You only get $500 credit for a dependent over the age of 16.'
b'Yes you would need to file so they have the necessary info to send the $1,200.\n\nAlso, you should always file even if you\xe2\x80\x99re below the filing requirement. If you make under $12,000 in a year and had any federal income tax withheld, that money is yours.'
b"I know when I was added to my parent's car insurance even I was 20 (no point in having a license before), their bill more than doubled. Not sure how the math works out that I cost more than 2 adults lol."
b'Everything through the second trimester is child ticket, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what the problem is'
b'Everyone before three is free which is pretty fair. Loads of places will still charge your kid for a ticket. And you can easily fudge this by just saying your kid is still three for an extra year or two.'
b'Do you have any data to back up the return to a more historical age of first marriage / household formation? \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve just never read or seen anything saying that the 50s were abnormal in that people were getting married and starting families earlier than in previous times in history...'
b'Rice and beans.  Rice and beans.  They are growing and need nutrition, but there are easy (and cheap) ways to meet the nutritional requirements.'
b'Then quit talking and actually revolt.'
b'to bad nobody will actually do anything because this will only affect a minor portion of the population and everyone else will get their checks.'
b'Sounds good. Go revolt because the government owes you all the free money you want.'
b"Cope. You won't do anything! Your life is too good."
b"Don't forget cup-of-noodles if they are especially good..."
b"Wait, where on earth are they finding beans and rice? I think everyone went vegan where I live, because that stuff is as sold out as the toilet paper. Which they'll need with all that fiber they're probably not used to."
b'Cornbread and buttermilk, and good ol rice and beans.'
b"I claim adult daughter who is disabled, and from the sounds of it she doesn't get anything."
b"That makes sense. I assume they'll catch it. My situation is not nearly as dire as many other peoples, so I have no basis to complain."
b'I see. Thanks for explaining it to me.'
b"Yeah then why wouldn't their dependents need the money as well.\n\nLike I'm a college student who just lost her job, but is still a dependent of my mother. It's not like my mom doesn't need the money now that she also lost her job and now must financially support both me and my two sisters.\n\nWhat a dumb fucking law."
b'Which already exist for children under 16 too....'
b"Tax dependent has nothing to do with federal aid. My parents didn't claim me as a dependent and I worked and did my own taxes, but in fafsa's eyes you are a dependent until your 25 regardless off irs filing."
b"We would have tried that already if that worked. Being seen as an independent by FAFSA is borderline impossible until you're 24. Even if you paid every cent of tuition, room, board, etc. you are not considered independent of your parents income."
b'I remember doing it at 16. \n\nI had a job and my dad gave me turbo tax after Christmas and was like \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to do your taxes\xe2\x80\x9d and walked off. \n\nI was like what is this \n\noh I\xe2\x80\x99m getting money \n\nneat \n\nThey claimed me though until I was like 19 and joined the army. Even when I lived with them they didn\xe2\x80\x99t claim me as a dependent after army years.'
b"And now they're touting their multi-billion dollar surplus like an accomplishment.\n\nYou starved people to bank it, but go off I guess?"
b"Hold up...\n\nSo you have 7 mouths to feed on one paycheck & these freeloaders can't be bothered to watch your kid while you work?!?\n\nGet the hell outta here...seems to me you only have 2 mouths to feed, yours & your child's."
b"Based on the last general election, not really. There's a \xe2\x89\x8825% spread between 65+ turnout and 18-29 turnout.\n\n>In 2016, this was once again the case, as citizens 65 years and older reported higher turnout (70.9 percent) than 45- to 64-year-olds (66.6 percent), 30- to 44-year-olds (58.7 percent) and 18- to 29-year-olds (46.1 percent).\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html"
b'So maybe I need to consult a tax expert, but would it make better sense for a 17 yr old unemployed HS student file his/own taxes then? Since there is no financial benefit other than 500. It would get their feet wet in how to do their own taxes too.'
b'The level of justified outrage about this threads topic is going to look like child\xe2\x80\x99s play once people realize how long it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take to receive a check. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be extremely surprised if I have an ability to spend any of the money from this check before mid May.\n\n(\xe2\x95\xaf\xc2\xb0\xe2\x96\xa1\xc2\xb0\xef\xbc\x89\xe2\x95\xaf\xef\xb8\xb5 \xe2\x94\xbb\xe2\x94\x81\xe2\x94\xbb          <\xe2\x80\x94- people in about 20 days.'

b'4+ million.'
b'Yep, which is the best time to push it, just to see when the breaking point is for people.  Until then, push it and stand back and watch.'
b'Probably not, unfortunately.'
b"If they don't and he gets that money you might put it aside so if they catch it later you won't have to worry about paying it back."

b'Mine filed her taxes since she had a part-time job. We still claim her as a dependent though, so at 17, nobody gets the credit. Even though she had a job and filed.'
b"They could file but if unemployed,  they're probably a dependent child. There is the Credit For Other Dependents, even if those dependents are above 16. 16 is the cutoff for the Child Tax Credit specifically. The stimulus bill is providing $500 for each Child Tax Credit claimed, basically.\n\nEdited to include other credit"
b'Go to the Asian or Hispanic market.'
b'Yeah here in the epicenter of the us outbreak (pierce/king county) the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99m having trouble finding is toilet paper.'
b"I get this is an issue for some but for most young people it's just general apathy that keeps them from voting"
b'Sorry mate, work and study full time here and am 23. Still managed to vote. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make excuses for your fuck-assing about.'
b">It helps when you\xe2\x80\x99re retired and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about:\n\n>>work,\n\nGood excuse\n\n\n>exams,\n\nGood excuse \n\n\n>travel\n\nHuh? Why does going on vacation mean you're exempt from voting? You have to pick that day?\n\n> your social life (organizations & clubs).\n\nYou can't be serious."
b'This is so pathetic.'
b'What a lame excuse'
b'This is a bullshit argument, you cant be bothered to plan ahead and either vote by mail if allowed or spend an hour 1 day to go cast your ballot?'
b'Apathy, laziness, and ignorance are the biggest factors imo. So many young people are proud to say that they don\'t follow politics or "pay attention to that stuff." Yet it still affects them and the rest of us regardless...'
b"Some young people who do follow politics don't bother to vote. 3 of my close friends dragged me to a Bernie rally in Coney Island during 2016. None of them bothered to vote for him come primary day. Then they were shocked he lost NY."
b'COVID-19 is making people take everything. First there was Hand sanitizer, next bath tissue, now dogs.'
b'In a world where every morning starts with turning on the news and opening up reddit to see how much insane shit has happened in the past 8 hours, my dogs are the only normalcy left in my world.  Last month I knew I loved them.  This month, the love has grown exponentially because of the love they give and that I desperately need.  I know some people will abandon in a few months, but I suspect most will fall so in love with these little creatures that give us a feeling that we went back in time a couple months. They will never give them up.\n\nIf I were forced to say one positive thing the pandemic did...it made me realize dogs were 10x more incredible than they already were.  Give yours dogs a treat.'
b'These is great and both people and the animals benefit greatly. I have one concern about this though. What happens once people return to their jobs ? Will these animals suffer seperation anxiety as they were brought into a new home environment where alot of their owners are stuck at home all day with this COVID-19 outbreak. These animals will be so accustomed to having their owner there all the time. I just wonder how this will affect the animals.'
b"Cats and dogs are absolutely loving it right now. I'm telling you we're getting so much damn affection it's ridiculous. No jokes last 2 weeks have been amazing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican dog. Not wild."
b'Wonder how many of them will get abandoned again after this is all over. \xf0\x9f\x98\x95'
b"I remember when a lot of people adopted huskies because of the direwolves in Game of Thrones but ended up returning/abandoning said huskies later on. I hope it doesn't happen this time"
b'Panic adoption of dogs, kennels empty.\nDo they have a no return policy to prevent dog hoarding?'
b'I feel this need too and so do my kids.  I want to adopt two cats so they are not lonely once this ends.  We have the time to find them, organize the house and get to know each other.  Perfect time to give them a forever home.'
b'I wonder what it is about a pandemic that makes people go and adopt pets.'
b'Something heartwarming amid the pandemic. Thank you for posting.'

b"There is risk of severe animal abuse, people could end up abandoning all these pets too, nothing good comes out of mass hysteria, so mass animal adopting isn't good either."
b"My dog passed away recently and while I am not sure if I am ready for a new dog just yet I did contact Dumb Friends League offering to foster and they said they had homes for all their foster animals so that's good news. I assumed a bunch of people would be dumping pets during this, but hopefully it's the other way around."
b'Going to need something to eat when the supply chains break down.\n\n\n/s'
b'My rescue dog that we adopted a year ago has been a lifesaver with this whole ordeal. It reinforces my belief that humans domesticated wolves when they became dogs not just for the practical benefits, but to keep themselves from going crazy.'

b"Let's hope these animals don't return though."
b'Hopefully the animals are kept once things die down'

b'This is so uplifting. It is inevitable that a number of them will be returned after the quarantine passes. People are mean. But it is also inevitable that a fraction of these people will fall in love with their animals and these animals have found their forever homes!'
b'That could be a good or bad thing. Imagine how many of them will go back or even be out of the streets after the quarantine'
b'I only hope that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a temporary thing so when this is all over, those adopted animals won\xe2\x80\x99t be let go.'
b'Hope these people keep the animals after things go back to normal'
b'And what will happen after things settle back to normal?'
b'Its just going to suck if after this is over theyre all returned to their cells by people they thought loved them'
b"I feel like this is going to end badly for many of these dogs after their owners realize they can't handle them after this whole thing blows over. \n\nMany shelter dogs experience terrible separation anxiety after being adopted and requires proper training to get past, which includes leaving the house or getting trainers, which aren't options. Those dogs are going to be so accustomed to their new owners always being there that once their owners go back to work, they are going to flip out."

b"oh no.... Impulse adopting a pet??...... Oh no no no that's very bad \xf0\x9f\x98\xad"
b'This is just another way of hoarding did. If things get really bad you can eat the dog.'
b'I hope they dont end up back there after the quarantines and isolation period are over.'
b'And they will be full again after'
b'And unlike most places where shelters are overflowing with pitbulls, Denver passed BSL to ban pitbulls. This means that all of these families, their children, and other pets, are so much safer. Too many shelters hide the violent pasts of pitbulls to simply try and free up space.'
b'The disgusting thing?  These same people will put these animals on the street when they go back to work OR SOONER!'
b'I am glad to hear that.  My dog, although he has his quirks, has been more protective than usual, a d gets me to leave the house.'
b'Finally some good news.'
b"Hope they're not carriers"
b'Aside from the logistics of actually going and getting the pet, this is a perfect time to bond with an animal.\n\nIt will probably even be easier to acclimate them to other people and animals after this, because you will have so much trust built up with each other by the time we normalize.'
b"I don't get this. If you get sick and have to be isolated at the hospital for 2 weeks, what's going to happen to your brand new dog? Just seems like extra stress and added complications to an already unpredictable time."
b"We have shelters in New Mexico that normally export animals.to Colorado. Some of those shelters are scrambling to take care of their excess now that they can't transport."
b'I hope people dont ditch these animals once everything goes back to normal.'
b'God, I love my state.'
b"I'm not so sure this should have a Good News flair... I mean, if folks had adopted these dogs in normal times, then yes, Great news..."
b'I hear a lot of dogs get surrendered as well...'
b'And then more than half if them will be returned or abandoned just like after xmas. People are selfish and stupid.'
b'I really love pets, especially cats, and with everything bad happening this makes me happy. These animals finally haves homes and owners to be with.'
b'[deleted]'
b"Wtf these people going to do with their dogs when they go back to work? Smh people not thinking.\n\nI'm glad these animals found a home though, however temporary."
b"And they are taking them to the dog park, because the governor didn't close those, so all these puppies are being petted by all the people at the dog parks. Spreading it all around."
b"I really hope first time dog and cat owners don't abuse or neglect the animals"
b'Hope adopters have got contingency plans for care if they fall ill'
b'This is the positivity we need right now TBH, \n\nWhat way to better socially distance yourself from people than devoting all your attention to a new dog who deserves the love and affection.'
b"It's really cool and all. I just really hope these people keep their new pet and not return once everything gets better. I hate when animals get abandoned and used like that."
b'I just hope they are not taken back once this is all over next year.'
b'I came for the dog article,  I stayed cuz if all the doggie lovers in this thread. Two adopted dogs from MA here'
b'Didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d tear up on Reddit tonight. Thanks though. Needed some happy tears.'
b"This is actually heartbreaking. If they couldn't have a dog when they were working wtf makes them think they can have one now? They will go back to working... and what? Turn the dog back in? Like a fucking rental service."
b'I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not because the grocery store was out of meat :|'
b'While that\xe2\x80\x99s good! It\xe2\x80\x99s bad because these poor animals most likely will be returned after it goes away.'
b"Wait till Covid-19 becomes transferable via pets, there's gonna be mass abandonment.\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2020/03/27/first-known-cat-infected-with-coronavirus-reported-in-belgium/"
b'I hope they don\xe2\x80\x99t see a resurgence of dogs being left at shelters after ppl go back to work. Impulse adoptions are not always ideal. Ppl don\xe2\x80\x99t always think of the time, energy, and expense it takes to care for a dog. I\xe2\x80\x99ve volunteered in shelters and have seen this happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking for the dogs.'
b'This made me think of the time my sisters dog was stolen by the neighbors!'
b"The benefit of these dogs being socialized in a home rather than the impersonal setting of a shelter, even in a failed adoption where they're eventually returned, is still a positive outcome for many of these animals IMO."
b"I really hope this continues... and the animals aren't abandoned right after the self-isolation ends.   \n\n\nOn the positive side though: I really hope the animals are being treated awesomely! If I didn't have a zoo in my house already I would be tempted to adopt another dog."
b'This is great, I hope this becomes a trend. I was worried dogs would lose homes because people could no longer \xe2\x80\x9cafford\xe2\x80\x9d them. There was also a rumour people thought dogs could give them the virus (obviously this is hugely false).'
b'People want dogs for the anticipated lawlessness.  Dogs watching your house as you sleep.'
b'Dogs secretly adapted this corona virus as an new nationwide adoption campaign. It is working beyond their wildest expectations!'
b'No one is going to mention how the Denver area has outlawed \xe2\x80\x9caggressive breeds\xe2\x80\x9d or that when that law passed they went through and killed all of the aggressive breeds?'
b"I don't think is good to take animals to relieve your borderom and get yourself company. Things will return back to normal so you better be ready for the responsibility"
b'Everyone wants a companion in the apocalypse....'
b'This is a good problem to have'
b'People feel scared. They are getting these dogs to protect their homes at night. To alert them to Intruders.'
b"I wasn't allowed to adopt today!  My cat's brother, Spooky, died, due to congenital kidney issues, and she's bored, I wanted to get her a companion.  I'm working long hours and going from warehouses back to nursing due to the nursing shortage/needs.  I have the means to take good care of them is what I'm saying, but our local adoption programs are unsure if animals can carry or transmit the virus, no adoptions!"
b'This is what happens when people can\xe2\x80\x99t find meat in the stores'
b'Perfect time to raise a dog!'
b'People be hoarding everything.'
b'Cause he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s not Colorado....'
b'Hey looks like the viruses arent such asshats'
b'Now can we check on the situation in non-rescue sectors like PetSmart, etc? Does anyone have any updates on the situation in places like that?'
b"I just hope and pray that after all these is over, those who adopted these pets won't return them to the shelter.\n\nGive them unconditional love just as they give them to you."
b'My family just adopted a dog today (admittedly not from a shelter, from a puppy mill) and even their shelves were half empty.'
b"I hope this isn't related to food shortages"
b'Yesss, my city made national news for something actually positive and not stupid for once!\n\nAlso, my sister volunteered there for a while'
b'I beat the rush! Have had my little four legged friend for 2 weeks now.  Thank you Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region!'
b'I Christ, I thought I was JOKING when I said that people were going to start panic buying puppies next! No one was supposed to take me seriously!'
b"My wife adopted a new doggo.   Her reasoning is if she's stuck at home for a long time might as well house-train a puppers!"
b"I'm available if the shelters need volunteers to power wash these kennels down! Will absolutely post to r/powerwashingporn!! Seriously! PM me if anyone knows how to go about it!!"
b'The responses are hilarious, but in all seriousness we are looking to adopt because we are worried there will be a lot of shelter animals euthanized at this time because no one is leaving their house. So maybe people with a similar mindset are doing the same thing?'
b"For those of you who have been thinking of getting a pet, now is a good time to get since it will have more time to get used to you, since you will be mostly home. Just don't abandon them after the quarantine is over."
b'Is this really a good thing? When people no longer need the emotional support and no longer have the time to give as much attention to their pets as they could before bad things are bound to happen'
b'This whole thing was a conspiracy hatched by doggos...'
b"What's the correlation here? Are people adopting these animals due to loneliness? I'm not trying to talk shit this is a great side effect of this pandemic."
b'Wait till people go back to work and kennels be full again. I know this is pessimistic but people under estimate the amount of time, energy and work a pet takes. In addition to the cost as we head into a bear market/recession.'
b'This is awesome! This is the same shelter where I got my dog!'
b"Not good. Lots of emotional rather than thought through decisions, won't end well for many of the dogs. Hang out on the dog sub for a few weeks, you'll see. A lot of people don't seem to realize these are not animated stuffed toys. They are fellow mammals with their own likes and dislikes and sense of agency. They don't exist to cure your depression or make your boo boo better. Do the homework, have the money for vet bills, have the freaking time, have the temperament."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried this, as have many UK friends, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big no from adoption agencies here. Reason being is they say they have to do a property check on you to see if you have a suitable home, and also if there are problems with the dog they have to come out to your house to check on the dog and, because of Covid, they\xe2\x80\x99re (rightly) refusing to do this.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame though as there are lots of people who want to short-term foster, or adopt, a dog at this time, but the agencies rules won\xe2\x80\x99t let you.'
b'Can we stop marking this as good news? When this blows over we are gonna see a lot of abandoned pets as people get busy and as people start regretting their impulse decision.'
b'Dukh worry itb be Full again after the dust at settles. Human beings are A holes when going is good'
b'So people wait till they should stay home and then panic shop for animals?'
b'Gotta keep track of extra food sources in a crisis'
b'How about we empty the orphanages.......Plenty kids do not even have a home, save the one they are stuck in.'
b'Covid-19 has been a boon for my dogs. Now that i work from home my dogs get to spend more time with me and 3-4 long walks a day as compared to 2 short walks on working weekday being out. They are getting more active than ever and inspire me to workout on everyday.'
b'Do they see them as an emergency meat or pets to snuggle with? Maybe a bit of both...'
b'Downvoted for misleading title. Most are going to foster homes and will be returned. Not that it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing but based on majority of comments, people think this is some miracle where all these animals are being adopted. Not true. And if it was that would be even worse because it would mean countless pets in homes totally unprepared to actually care for an animal.'
b'I hope they keep them'
b"Because they're eating them. Dog stew > show stew"
b"They're going to fatten them up with all the TP they bought"
b'I swear if one you runs out of food dont eat the dog'
b'WHO let the dogs out!'
b'People are hoarding doggies, too'
b'Just more food hoarding.'
b'Maybe they can take animals from other shelters to help out.'
b"I'm glad animals are getting adopted..I worry about the massive return / anondonment when people get back to their normal lives."
b"Everyone thinks it's because lonliness, buts it's actually because the upcoming food shortages."
b'we need to make sure no adopted animal ends up abandoned after the outbreak'
b'This is the best thing that has happened to animals and the environment'
b'Stocking up on food.'
b'Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s also that pets aren\xe2\x80\x99t coming in as much (puppies less likely to be found because people aren\xe2\x80\x99t out and about)...? Not to be a downer. Soz.'
b'Free meat!'
b'This is unfortunately not the case everywhere right now. In Spain (sos shelter) my fiance voluntarily take care of 15 dogs mostly alone and no one is allowed to move to any new home since quarantine. Dog food and snacks running low since restriction and far less sponers.'
b'Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s out here lonely as fuck from self-isolating snatching up all the animals \xf0\x9f\x98\x82. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I got my cat this January, she\xe2\x80\x99s been amazing support.'
b'I just had the most grim thought. Is this going to be like Christmas and have a wave of pets dropped at kennels directly afterward?'
b'Are people planning on\xe2\x80\xa6 Eating them?'
b'With this virus, people need emotional support animals and animals need emotional humans.'
b'People are home together for an extended period of time and can properly train and accustom a dog to a new living space. Really is a good time for a new pup.'
b'Breeding pair of dogs is pretty smart idea.'
b"Best thing I've read since this started"
b"Just make sure that you take care of them, after the virus fucked off. I wouldn't like to see them becoming Easter bunnies put out on the street, when Easter is over."
b'Just gonna suck when all of this is over, and about 1/4 will be returned.'
b'This is the best news to come out at this time'
b'This is what Shelter-at-home must be!\n\nWhen most people were out getting TP, I was getting a Covid Support Animal. A wonderful three year-old mutt from a shelter(I was going to do it anyway, my last dog died last summer, and it was time). Best decision ever, lots of time to get to know and to bond.'
b"Folks get lonely when they're locked in their home"
b'Food shortage must be getting real.'
b'I really hope people consider seriously before making the decisions, and not abandon them again once this whole thing is over.'
b'These people will bring them all back.'
b'Where are they getting the dog food from?  Or is this what happens when the meat isle runs low?'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s great news! Please help out transporting pets to you [El Paso Texas Needs Help](https://elpasoanimalservices.org//)'
b'I work at a dog shelter and this happened at ours as well. We initially made a big push for fostering. Then, when we found out we might not be able to work or afford to pay workers we made the cats and dogs free to adopt.'
b'But... c-c..can you wipe with a french bull terrier ?'
b'Now this is what you should panic buy'
b'[removed]'
b"first all the toilet and now the pets? when will people's hoarding addiction be quenched?"
b"I now have a kitty I'm fostering. I can always choose to adopt her later if I want, but I hope people choosing adoption from the get go are truly committing and thinking about the animal's future"
b"If people had more time at home, more people would adopt and foster pets. Let's save some animals and let people work from home more when this is all over too."
b"Are there anyone noticed that, animal can have COIVD-19 the coronavirus too?    \n\nI think there are some cases shown dog can be media of COVID-19 ......\n\nThere are risk to both human and animal , so I don't think it was a good idea to adopt any animal right now."
b'Is this because people are in quarantine and have nothing else better to do? What happens when they gotta go back to work?'
b'1% for every IQ point anon has'
b'Heck yes. Love my state.'
b'Well peoples gotta eat'
b'They are probably getting hungry now the markets are empty'
b"Alright obviously a lot of people are dying or sick and that's really terrible. Shit, I'm in at least three risk categories so if I die you have my permission to celebrate my demise, and I'm already mourning my 401(k).\n\nBut does anyone else see an overall positive outcome here? The animals are being adopted, corporations are being forced to set up remote work and time off, everything is going online, the economy is being rearranged to help workers rather than the other way around. \n\nThis virus might be the best thing that's happened in my lifetime."
b'Lets hope people don\xe2\x80\x99t abandone those animals after things go back to normal'
b"That's really a good news."
b'First toilet paper... Now this!'
b'they better put up all sales are final signs up now.'
b'Here un Spain with the lockdown, dogs are a precious posession , as dog owners are one of the few people allowed to left home during quarantine.'
b'This is good tho right?'
b'They better not be eating them!'
b'Snacks just in case food is in short supply'
b"I'm just worried about what happens as the pandemic subsides and people head back to work.  I don't want to see a ton of pets get dumped once they are inconvenient."
b'This feels like crypto-kitties all over again'
b'This has the be the best thing COVID-19 has done.'
b'Thats some nice and good news.'
b"Thing is, most people are adopting to have something to do. There's no guarantee that most of those animals won't end up in a shelter again after the quarantine is over"
b'This is fantastic! But I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing a lot of random stories like this on this sub that originally was for quality research, facts, and news related to surviving the virus. \n\nI get it, I want good news too. But I kinda wish there was a second sub (with the same moderators even) for general related news.'
b"Shows that people always wanted pets but never had the time before now! I hope they won't abandon these pets after the crisis is over..."
b'Turns out the way to solve shelter overpopulation was to get people out of work'
b'Please be very responsible all adopters \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"Statistics we'll never get: Animals abandoned or returned after the panic is over."
b"I just want to add that this is NOT always good news!!\n\nIn the UK Drug dealers/thieves are using dogs to get outside and carry on as 'normal', I even know people borrowing their dogs to others for a few weeks for a 'free score' to allow their dealers to make money off addicts :/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I was joking."
b"This sub was advertised as a way to stay informed, now it's just people complaining about what dramma people cause because of the virus"
b"It's like that everywhere. My daughter was looking to adopt last week but all the kennels are empty."
b'This is great, as animals are finding a home. I just hope this isn\xe2\x80\x99t temporary and owners don\xe2\x80\x99t lose interest once things go back to a somewhat normal state.'
b"In India, there's a rumour spread dogs are contracting the virus. Due to this, lots of dogs left to the street by their owners."
b'Hate to be the downer here but these pets are being adopted because their new owners don\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel alone, not because they want to care for a pet. If the latter was the case the shelters woulda been empty before corona...'
b"Let's hope they take proper care of those animals. Panicking buying  is ridiculous, and could result in dogs being quickly returned and that could mess up the dogs mental health."
b'One of the good things coming out'
b"Hmm, for pets right!? I'd hate to think it's for other reasons! Haha"
b"While it's good news that they have finally found homes, people who aren't prepared for the responsibility of owning a pet are going to be in for a big shock."
b"I always feel mixed about this. I know r/dogs complains about rescues being too strict, but background checks are important for the long-term well-being of pets. Being able to adopt pets quickly could lead to more impulse adoptions, unsuitable owners, and pets being given up. But I've heard others argue that even a mediocre owner is better than a kennel."
b'And cats'
b'Apparently TV\xe2\x80\x99s and Nintendo Switches as well.'
b'A dog is for life, not just Corona'
b"I hope they don't take dogs because they couldn't get toilet paper"
b'Seeds, for planting vegetable garden.\nFlour & yeast. Suddenly baking bread.'
b'Gotta wipe with *something.*'
b'NEXT IS OUR JERBS'
b'You left out white flour.. for some reason even people self diagnosed gluten-free are buying up white flour'
b'What! There is a shortage on puppies?!'
b'How well to they work replacing toilet paper?'
b'Chloroquine is the new toilet paper'
b'All the fucking ICE CREAM'
b'There was a hot run on top soil at rural king. It\xe2\x80\x99s the new TP.'
b'makes sense to have some self cleaning fur around in case of running out of toilet paper...'
b'If they go hungry they can eat the dog'
b'Hide yo wife! Hide yo kids!'
b'Gotta get some emergency food!'
b"They're going to eat them."
b'what else imma clean with'
b'What happens when life goes back to \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d. Their life gets busy, can\xe2\x80\x99t take care of the animal, and look where we are'
b'Hey, when all the canned food is gone you got to eat somehow.'
b'Wonder how many people will take them back after this is over'
b'except me'
b'Hold up, what the fuck are bath tissues?'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re out of toilet paper. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re wiping with dogs. Truly desperate times.'
b'Gotta eat.'
b'The foster demand for LA dogs has outnumbered the supply too! So happy.'
b"What's bath tissue?"
b'My dog passed away about a month ago and it is killing me being at home all the time and not having her here. The house feels so empty without her and damn what I would give to have her happy stupid face to cheer me up during all this.\n\nEnjoy this extra time you have with them, it is one of the truly good things to come out of all this mess.'
b'Agreed. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always loved my four-legged dipshit, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been missing her big time since the quarantine set in. (she lives with my mom right now because pet rent is overpriced bullshit) Dogs are amazing, and her being so excited to see me during our rare trips to visit could honestly make me cry.'
b"I got home from work this morning, feeling beat up, scared that I'll catch and bring something home, doing my brand new ritual of taking my scrubs off inside my garage and throwing them immediately into the washer, wearing a different pair of shoes each day because it survives on a surface for 72 hours, taking a hot shower immediately.\n\nThen I opened the door leading into the house and my two dogs were standing by the door, tails wagging, waiting for me and it made everything okay. I'm so happy knowing I can't infect them. That would kill me."
b'how dare you talk about your doggo and not provide a picture. GOOD DAY SIR.'
b'I need to see your dogs op plz'
b'My morning begins the same way, you took the words right out of my mouth'
b'International community of dogs has approved this. I love you woof!!'
b'Same but with my kitty cats'
b'Mine died in January. We miss him now more than before, and keep thinking how we would everyone being at home with him 24/7.'
b"Coloradan who knows employees who work there, most of the dogs have been taken by foster homes who are familiar with the process of rehab and return. Unfortunately, a lot of dogs will be returning to the facility but it's not like they will be abandoned, it's just part of the process.\n\nPikes Peak Humane Society are great, I got my dog from them a couple years ago. They're doing the best they can possibly do for all the animals under their care, trust."
b'May still be better than a kennel... depending on the situation, but I hear ya.'
b'My point of view is purely anecdotal, but I was one of the people who went to a shelter before a lockdown was put in place and adopted a dog (I\xe2\x80\x99m in NYS so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been holed up about a week and a half now.) We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some degree of separation anxiety already and it\xe2\x80\x99s been one of my top concerns - we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving our new pup in the crate longer and longer each day, and even though we just go into a room where she can\xe2\x80\x99t see us, it\xe2\x80\x99s already helping her to learn that we won\xe2\x80\x99t always be within arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach of her. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that can be worked on even while everyone is home. I may be in the minority in starting this kind of training so soon, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to suffer when life returns to some degree of normalcy.'
b'I talked to my dog trainer today after he\xe2\x80\x99s had to shut down his whole business during this time and he told me he is working on something to post on his business Facebook page for this reason.'
b'not to sound insensitive but anxious is how most animals live their entire lives. heck, a good percentage of humans live like that.'
b'Everyone with newly adopted animals who normally work need to let them spend time alone. So they get used to being alone before you return to work.'
b'In my view being adopted and placed in a loving home even if they experience separation anxiety is far far better to a life in a shelter. Think of it as the difference between being homeless or living in an apt with loud neighbors in the bad part of town where there\xe2\x80\x99s bars on the windows. It\xe2\x80\x99s still better than sleeping on the streets.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s likely it will be a gradual return to normalcy in our lives so I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic the dogs will have time to adjust slowly.'
b'Plenty of time to kennel train during this time, even if you spoil the puppers and let them sleep in bed occasionally'
b'Good point, my dog is from the pound and he can\xe2\x80\x99t be left alone at all coz of separation anxiety'
b'One hurdle at a time. \nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how much at least I could take right now. \n\nHello from NY.'
b'my thoughts exactly'
b"I don't think it'll be high, but I could see some folks using dog ownership as a way to break quarantine.  Hopefully anyone that did this falls in love with their pupper though."
b'We are working on making sure our puppy gets crate time while we are either outside or in other parts of the house.\n\nAny other recommendations?  Would love the help \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b"It will take adjustment for sure but there are methods to alleviate separation anxiety for pets.  It's gotta be easier for them than living in a shelter at any rate."
b'Small price to pay to have a home in my opinion.'
b'Dog food shortage on the horizon'
b'Generally animals get anixety issues at home because of a lack of training and support early on. Like there is a bit of time sink to get a pet sorted out in your house, months but ideally a year or two if its a puppy.  Id like to think people didnt have time to train thier own dog or cat and now they do.'
b"My bigger concern is that folks are only getting these dogs because they are bored being stuck at home. Why weren't these people adopting before this pandemic?"
b'Lmao dude chill.'
b"We Coloradans are incredibly serious about our dogs. You might have dog people where you're from, but you don't know dog people until you've lived in my town. But seriously, I think for the most part the dogs will be well taken care of and have active lives what with all the hiking, biking, etc. The shelters are also very good here and they do their best to look into people first. Most will have foster experience, and I'll bet most of the adopters have rescued before as well. Honestly I think in my experience this is a great time to do it - you can still get your dog used to time away (going to the store or something for short periods) but you assist through the learning curve - my dog took a few months before she would stop destroying everything and freaking the fuck out and I wish I could have been home for more of that time."
b'I think it\'s more that it\'s a good time to be potty training the animal. \n\nLots of dogs end up in homes with lots of love.  \n\nAlso, in general, we import tons of dogs from other states, so it\'s not that weird we "ran out."  My dog is from New Mexico.'
b"Actually, I think my cats are social distancing from me for every extra hour I'm home."
b"> I'm telling you we're getting so much damn affection\n\n...are... you... dog?"
b"Hi, I'm a Coloradan who knows people that work at this Humane Society. Most of the dogs were taken by foster homes familiar with rehab and return. They'll be back in the system once this blows over, to reduce stress on the facility as a whole during the outbreak.\n\nI got my dog from them a few years ago and try to drop off extra food or leashes and leads when I can. Please believe they didn't just give away all the dogs to random people. Everything possible is being done to impact the animals the least during these troubled times. Pikes Peak Humane Society are good people who put the animals first."
b"Not my corona baby, that's for sure. We had been planning to get a dog for many months but with the virus coming and the possible quarantine we kind of rushed to get a dog from the shelter and got a beautiful 6 yo kind soul. Spoiled rotten right now and forever to come. If it wasn't for the virus we would've kept waiting for *the perfect breed* which I'm glad didn't happen because we really lucked out with the perfect dog. I am sure many more were adopted in a similar fashion."
b'this isnt gonna be over any time soon. and when it does, life will forever change to move towards WFH, more sick and PTO leave.'
b'Wonder how many won\xe2\x80\x99t be abandoned, at least some would find their forever-home and it\xe2\x80\x99s better than nothing.'
b'Like all of them'
b"That's my thought. Any asshole that abandons something they've adopted now deserves to be thrown out on the fucking street in the dead of winter.\n\nSpay or neuter your pets. If you get a pet, you get a pet expecting it to be for life. If you aren't ready for that level of commitment, you don't do it. Anything less and you need to sit down and have a hard look at yourself, because you are a shitty person."
b"I've wondered that too. And how much attention will these pets get once life resumes normally and their owners can be out and about. If you loved animals and wanted a pet....why wait until a devastating event happens. Why didn't you adopt a pet much sooner before any of this started."
b'Is it because Huskies were harder to take care of, then people thought?'
b'It will'
b"Shelters around the world are closing for isolation, so it's this or be terminated. I don't see a problem with some being returned when they reopen."
b'I hope so too. It reminds me of the Chihuahua \xe2\x80\x9ccraze\xe2\x80\x9d when Paris Hilton was popular. Afterwards, many shelters were filled with Chihuahuas that were returned or surrendered. I remember watching it on the news years ago so this current news gives me mixed feelings.'
b'People are losing their minds and making all kinds of impulsive decisions and it\xe2\x80\x99s only been like two weeks. Just imagine what it will be like two months from now.'
b'Maybe lonely people having to quarantine alone.'
b'I waited to adopt until I knew I could be home a lot during the first couple/few weeks at least to help them adjust better. Maybe others let that play a factor now too, aside from the loneliness'
b"They're not really adopting, they're fostering. And it's because the shelters needed clearing out before lockdown happens."
b'I saw a campaign on twitter earlier encouraging people to do it because lots of people losing jobs would be giving up their pets'
b'They\xe2\x80\x99re just getting prepared for when they run out of soup.\n\n...too soon?'
b'the dale gribble approach'
b'Well, the Korean approach to lockdown has already been shown to be pretty effective.'

b'That is my worry of this as well. I feel conflicted with this news; on one hand, I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy that these sweet pups are gaining families and yet on the other hand, I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned that given time many people (not all) will return the dog because it was only to fulfill a desire at a certain point but not for long run. \n\nIt brings to my mind when experts advise people not to adopt or purchase puppies, kittens, chicks, baby ducks, bunnies, etc. solely as gifts for fleeting occasions such birthdays, Christmas, Valentines Day or Easter but rather, make sure that you have done your research and preparation to welcome a new pet. I also remember when Paris Hilton and other socialites were super popular and people went crazy for Chihuahuas yet, once the hysteria was over, shelters were packed with these returned chihuahuas. I know that people have good intentions but I hope the dogs aren\xe2\x80\x99t cheated at the end, if that makes sense.'

b"This is not necessarily true. I adopted a second dog yesterday, but my original plan was to wait for the summer since I am a SPED teacher.

This was the perfect time for me to find my second dog."

b'When I lost my dog I mourned him for 10 years. I still cry sometimes thinking about him.

b'No. Quite literally no. There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be so many abandoned pets it\xe2\x80\x99s not even funny. \n\nIf these people were not pet people before, they\xe2\x80\x99re not pet people now. With some exceptions. \n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t just go pick up another life to be responsible for for the next 12 years, because you\xe2\x80\x99re bored at home during a quarantine. \n\nThis is not going to end well.'

b"I'm in Spain and over here people are getting dogs for the excuse to go on walks because that is considered essential. It's kinda funny how many people have dogs now"
b"We're going to have to fight to keep all of those before this is over. Everything that makes life easier for workers makes them less dependent on their bosses.\n\nJust look at what a clusterfuck Silicon Valley is, Googlers living in Google's parking lots or paying a majority of their salary just for the right to continue to work in the Valley. It's a rat race and it makes property owners exorbitantly wealthy."
b'Abandoning is bad, but rehoming to a person you take the time to vet properly shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be shamed.\n\nIt should be a last resort sure, but shaming people leads to more anonymous abandonments at shelters.'
b'even if you aren\'t ready for the commitment, if you actually decide to adopt anyway- you don\'t get to abandon a life, an emotional, sentient being who has been lead to believe they will have a loving home- its fucking diabolical and people who do it should be listed on an national "do not adopt" list so they can never again ruin another animals life.'
b"\n>Why didn't you adopt a pet much sooner before any of this started.\n\nI've been waiting for a good stretch of time at home (longer than two weeks) to help a dog I'd adopt acclimate to me and our new lives together, establish our routine. Eventually I would have to return to working 8 hr days, but live close enough that I can come home for lunch.\n\nWithout that extended period together, I won't adopt a dog.

b'Wait. You kept the dog right? I read this and was like WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG! HOW DO YOU FAIL AT DOGS. My bad.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of city shelters that are so overwhelmed. I volunteered at one and when my brother came in looking for a dog the director looked him up and down and said \xe2\x80\x9cjust take him\xe2\x80\x9d. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to pay the $50.'
b'Uhh when my county shelter is full they give out dogs and cats for free. The process is you go in, pick a dog, hang out with it in a big fenced yard and decide whether you want the animal or not. If anything, they were pushy about adopting the dog we went to consider.'
b'I just fostered a dog from the Houston city shelter two days ago.  I submitted an application online (basically saying I own my house, with a backyard, have no kids or other pets, and have never owned a dog) and picked out a dog from their website.  Two days later, they walked her out to my car and said "good luck"!\n\nThey literally hand out animals lol'
b'No, it may seem that way but you literally enter the most basic of info and they look at your most basic info online. A questionaire that is easily lied to and your ready to go. I\'ve adopted from CO as well as TX and LA and it\'s all the same. Not really "making sure a good fit" because they literally knew 0 about me other than what I would write down myself (which could easily be bullshit)'
b'Same in the UK, they come and see your house, enquire about your job and family situation- they won\xe2\x80\x99t let you take an animal which isn\xe2\x80\x99t good with kids if you have some for example. They even randomly pop in a few months later to check your animal is happy and healthy.\n\nI believe the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust make you sign a contract which states the animal is basically still legally theirs and they can come and take it back if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking after it at anytime. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it then you have to return it to them for example.  \n\nI guess it depends on the animal laws and how much power these organisations have in your country.'
b'The not-cynical part of me wants to believe the majority of these people had been considering getting a dog and this virus just provided a "perfect time"\n\nI want to believe most of these people didnt just get a dog because they were bored.\n\nEdit: u/galactic_apricot posted this\n\nHi, I\'m a Coloradan who knows people that work at this Humane Society. Most of the dogs were taken by foster homes familiar with rehab and return. They\'ll be back in the system once this blows over, to reduce stress on the facility as a whole during the outbreak.\n\nI got my dog from them a few years ago and try to drop off extra food or leashes and leads when I can. Please believe they didn\'t just give away all the dogs to random people. Everything possible is being done to impact the animals the least during these troubled times. Pikes Peak Humane Society are good people who put the animals first.'
b'Quarantine does seem like the perfect time to housetrain that puppy you\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to get for a while though...'
b'As someone who adopted a dog just now because of COVID this is upsetting to hear the cynicism. My wife and I have been waiting for us to have time to adopt and to get a dog kennel trained and ensure their is no separations anxiety. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to adopt then leave it for 6 hours while we work right away. We put careful consideration into this and have a plan to prepare our dog for when this ends. \n\nGranted I am a teacher and know we have until September at a minimum but I really hate all these people assuming that people will treat these animals poorly. Yes some will go back but I believe a lot of people just need the 2-4 weeks to get a dog used to their environment and ensure their would be no separation anxiety and are jumping in the opportunity.'
b"Just to maybe make you feel slightly better. We've been planning for a year to get a cat this summer but are going to get one next week now as we figure it's the best time to get a cat comfortable with our house etc with life literally on hold."
b'Eh, been considering a dog for years. If I had a landlord that allowed it, now might be a good time to do the kind of intensive early training that makes for a great lifelong companion. It kinda depends on your reasons,  I guess.'
b"The problem with your argument is these animals were already abandoned. So worst case they're back where they started.\n\nIt sounds like the animals have simply gone to foster homes during the pandemic and most will be returned once it's safe to do so."
b'...and what is the consequence of abandoned pets? Where do they go?'
b'I said depending on the situation. Re-lax.'
b"I mean, I'm not one of these people but I've been thinking about getting another dog for a while but am too busy for the initial training/socialization. For us at least the first couple of months with a new dog are a lot more work than afterward, particularly if you already have at least one dog and are used to the routine. Not saying there aren't people who aren't thinking this through, but there are a lot of people who'd love to have a(nother) pet but circumstances haven't allowed for it. Well, they're allowing it now."
b'Wow, gate keep much? I\xe2\x80\x99m a dog owner myself, as are many of my friends, and I can confidently say that we\xe2\x80\x99re not significantly different from our friends who don\xe2\x80\x99t own dogs.

b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case everywhere. I used to live in a semi-rural town in the south and when my friend tried to adopt a cat at the SPCA, they literally sent a worker to his house to make sure conditions were good for the cat. And they turned him down because he already owned a dog.'
b'But how can an answer this logical be the case? The other guy clearly quite literally said no!'
b'Yes this is me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to get a puppy since I moved away from my hometown. I grew up with dogs, I raised my puppies that still live with my parents, so I know how much work goes into training a puppy and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it from an office downtown. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99m home, I knew it was the perfect time. I got her on Monday and I\xe2\x80\x99m so in love with her.'
b"I volunteer at a small rescue in the Denver area and have worked at animal shelters in other states before this. I just want to say that animals who get returned are often changed by the experience, and typically not for the better. It's  traumatic to be uprooted from life multiple times in a row. I see animals revert or suddenly take on feral behaviors. It makes it harder for them to trust so completely again. The aim is always to adopt to forever homes. \n\nFoster homes are a bit different, at least in the cat world. It is meant for pets that don't thrive in the shelter, end-of-life care, raising kittens to an appropriate age to be adopted, socializing kittens,  and of course emergencies. Fosters go through training and are meant to be quiet, safe spaces. \n\nShelters always see adoption surges close to Easter and other holidays. Ours is temporarily closed to visitors in order to comply with the shelter in place orders. Our biggest concerns are things like making rent when we rely solely on donations and fundraisers, ensuring people know they can still surrender animals in need (especially with kitten season starting,) and at the same time protecting the health and safety of the cats, our staff, and volunteers. \n\nThe best way you can help shelter pets right now is direct donation via PayPal, GoFundMe, or Chewy orders. Also consider making purchases through AmazonSmile to donate to a charity of your choice or just straight up donations via Amazon packages. New volunteers and fosters would have to go to orientations and training so probably best to stay home until this is over."

b"Please don't do that. I know that the grocery store is the only thing that is open. I get it, I work there and see you EVERY single day.  I get it, you are bored. \n\nJesus fuck. Don't be a vector. Don't make me one. Get what you want and need for the week."
b'Or just like another wet market'

b'[I have no problem with geese I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying they make the best toilet paper alternative](https://knowledgenuts.com/2014/08/11/why-you-should-wipe-yourself-with-a-gooses-neck/)'
b'Wait...you need to marinate the goose first???'
b'Got it, the whole world has a problem with you.'
b'I suggest chalet that marinate*'
b'I did that with my bird... sort of. Except all I said was, "so you\'re saying it\'s legal if I just keep him?" lol'
b'Awww I love that. \xf0\x9f\xa5\xb0'
b'Nice story'
b'Lol!'
b'Dude for serious? I got my cat at the humane society and they gave me a questionnaire but didn\xe2\x80\x99t verify anything. Just took my money and I took her home right then.'
b'> SPCA\n\nAre you in Canada? Feel like our situation might be better lol'
b'Yeah, I wanted to adopt a cat from a shelter but they want you to bring in your apartment lease and it to specifically state pet friendly and since mine did not state that, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t adopt. My place is pet friendly, but it was never written in. So I bought one kitten from a breeder and got one kitten from my mom\xe2\x80\x99s when her cat had a litter.'
b'Because we must be as cynical as possible on Reddit! You\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot if you try and look at things positively!'
b"I'm so happy for you two :) good to know some good can come from a bad situation"
b"I'm going to give my dog some extra kisses tonight. Thanks for the work you do."
b'My cat was found at a few months old and taken to the Humane Society. Adopted some time later and returned after a short time. When I met her they told me she was a shy kitty and perhaps would never come around. It\xe2\x80\x99s been two years now and she is the most loving affectionate kitty. But I\xe2\x80\x99d never even think to kennel her when going out of town because I\xe2\x80\x99d hate for her to think she was being returned again.'
b"Not quite, but there were probably venerated and were often mummified. Sometimes family pets, as opposed to the ones that were sacrificed, would even get their own coffin. It's said the ancient egyptians believed that cats carried a bit of divine energy in them."
b'Reminds me of my mummified Siamese cat.  I would think that would increase in value if cat is the new currency'
b'What kind of bird?'
b'Yeah we were both shocked. Maybe my friend is red flagged or something.'
b'Rolls? Are you making an exodia?'
b'Lol no I just forgot to add the A.'
b"If you've ever lived anywhere with an overabundance of mice and rats, you'd definitely venerate and deify cats."
b'They represented Bastet, who was a guardian of Ra.'
b'The ancient Egyptians were not wrong about this.'
b'Best thing about cats is that they clean themselves - no need to buy toilet paper for yourself!'
b'Especially when your civilization depends on stored grain'
b'Are you suggesting we can use cats as toilet paper?'
b"Exactly! They're just the right size for wiping and they're reusable so it's a win-win for the planet too!"
b'Absolutely, just clip their claws first, take it from me. Then they walk away brown and come back clean for next time'
